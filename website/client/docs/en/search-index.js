Federation is a powerful tool for sharing modules between multiple applications, but designing your application to take advantage of this feature requires careful planning and consideration. In this guide, we’ll explore some best practices and tips for designing your application to more easily use Module Federation. One of the most important considerations when designing an application for Module Federation is the architecture of the application itself. Applications that are designed with a modular architecture are better suited for sharing modules using Module Federation. A modular architecture involves breaking down an application into smaller, more manageable modules. Each module should have a well-defined set of responsibilities and should be designed to be as self-contained as possible. By designing an application in this way, modules can be more easily shared between different applications using Module Federation. When sharing modules between different applications, it is important to ensure that those modules are compatible with each other. This requires careful versioning and compatibility testing to ensure that changes to one module do not break other applications that rely on it. To ensure compatibility between shared modules, it is important to establish a clear versioning strategy. This strategy should define how versions are numbered, how backwards compatibility is maintained, and how changes to modules are communicated to other applications that rely on them. To learn more about versioning of modules, proceed to dedicated Versioned Shared Modules documentation page. To more easily use Module Federation, it is important to structure your code in a way that is well-suited to sharing modules. This involves organizing your code into modules and packages that can be more easily shared between different applications. In addition to organizing code into modules and packages, it is important to establish clear boundaries between different modules. This can be achieved through the use of well-defined interfaces and APIs, which allow different modules to communicate with each other in a standardized way. Effective dependency management is critical for designing an application that is well-suited for Module Federation. This involves carefully managing dependencies between modules to ensure that they can be easily shared between different applications. To more easily manage dependencies between modules, it is important to establish a clear dependency hierarchy. This hierarchy should define the relationships between different modules and should be designed to minimize dependencies between modules wherever possible. When sharing modules between different applications, it is important to establish clear communication protocols. This involves defining how different modules communicate with each other, and how data is passed between different applications. To establish clear communication protocols, it is important to standardize interfaces and APIs. This allows different modules to communicate with each other in a consistent and predictable way, which can help to reduce errors and improve maintainability. To more easily use Module Federation, it is important to design your application with testability in mind. This involves designing modules and packages that can be easily tested in isolation, as well as designing tests that can be easily run against shared modules. By designing modules and packages that are easily testable, developers can more easily ensure that changes to those modules do not break other applications that rely on them. This can help to reduce the risk of errors and improve the overall quality of the application. To learn more about testing of modules, proceed to dedicated How to Create Unit Tests for Distributed Code documentation page. When sharing modules between different applications, it is important to consider security implications. This involves designing modules and packages that are secure by default, as well as implementing security measures to protect shared modules from unauthorized access or modification. To ensure the security of shared modules, it is important to establish clear access control policies. This involves defining who has access to shared modules, as well as implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to those modules. To more easily use Module Federation, it is important to design your application with monitoring and metrics in mind. This involves designing modules and packages that can be easily monitored, as well as designing monitoring tools that can be used to track the performance of shared modules. By designing modules and packages that are easily monitorable, developers can more easily identify performance issues and other problems that may affect the overall quality of the application. This can help to improve the overall reliability and performance of the application. To get more visibility of your federated modules, we suggest using Medusa. Medusa provides visibility of tracking how every new feature update influences the performance, compare current, historical, and the upcoming version, discover insights, and take-data driven decisions. To more easily use Module Federation, it is important to design your application with performance in mind. This involves designing modules and packages that are optimized for performance, as well as designing tools that can be used to monitor and optimize the performance of shared modules. By designing modules and packages that are optimized for performance, developers can ensure that shared modules do not negatively impact the performance of the overall application. This can help to improve the user experience and ensure that the application can scale to meet increasing demand. When sharing modules between different applications, it is important to consider error handling. This involves designing modules and packages that are robust and resilient to errors, as well as designing error handling mechanisms to handle errors that occur in shared modules. To ensure that errors are handled effectively, it is important to establish clear error handling guidelines. This involves defining how errors should be logged and reported, as well as defining how errors should be handled in different contexts. To more easily use Module Federation, it is important to document shared modules and their APIs. This involves designing clear and comprehensive documentation for shared modules, as well as ensuring that the documentation is kept up-to-date as shared modules evolve over time. By designing clear and comprehensive documentation for shared modules, developers can more easily understand how different modules communicate with each other, and how data is passed between different applications. This can help to reduce errors and improve maintainability. Designing an application to more easily use Module Federation requires careful planning and consideration. By adopting a modular architecture, establishing clear versioning and compatibility strategies, organizing code effectively, and managing dependencies, developers can create applications that are well-suited for sharing modules between different applications using Module Federation. By following these best practices and tips, developers can take full advantage of the power and flexibility of Module Federation to create more modular and flexible web applications.","title":"Designing Your Application for Module Federation: Best Practices and Tips","component":"mf-docs","version":"0.2","name":"best-practices","url":"/mf-docs/0.2/best-practices/","titles":[{"text":"Modular Application Architecture","hash":"modular-application-architecture","id":1},{"text":"Versioning and Compatibility","hash":"versioning-and-compatibility","id":2},{"text":"Code Organization and Structure","hash":"code-organization-and-structure","id":3},{"text":"Dependency Management","hash":"dependency-management","id":4},{"text":"Communication Protocols","hash":"communication-protocols","id":5},{"text":"Testability","hash":"testability","id":6},{"text":"Security","hash":"security","id":7},{"text":"Monitoring and Metrics","hash":"monitoring-and-metrics","id":8},{"text":"Performance","hash":"performance","id":9},{"text":"Error Handling","hash":"error-handling","id":10},{"text":"Documentation","hash":"documentation","id":11},{"text":"Conclusion","hash":"conclusion","id":12}]},"2":{"id":2,"text":"In this documentation page, we’ll explore two different approaches to implementing Module Federation in your projects: Brownfield and Greenfield development. This guide is intended for advanced users and will provide a thorough understanding of the differences, advantages, and drawbacks of each approach. Module Federation is a powerful tool in Webpack 5 that enables you to share dependencies and modules across applications, providing significant performance improvements and enabling the creation of distributed applications. When considering implementing Module Federation in your projects, you’ll often come across two primary development approaches depending on the state of your current project: Brownfield Development: Integrating Module Federation into an existing application. Greenfield Development: Building a new application from scratch with Module Federation in mind. This guide aims to provide an in-depth understanding of both development strategies to help you make an informed decision on whether to start from scratch, or lean more towards a refactoring-way. Brownfield development refers to integrating Module Federation into an existing application. This can be a complex process, as it may involve refactoring existing code and adapting your application’s architecture to work with Module Federation. Leverage existing code and resources: You can continue building on your existing application, without needing to start from scratch. Incremental improvements: You can gradually introduce Module Federation into your application, improving performance and code sharing over time. Refactoring existing code: You may need to refactor parts of your existing application to accommodate Module Federation. This can be time-consuming and may introduce temporary instability. Potential architectural changes: Your existing application architecture might not be optimized for Module Federation, which may require significant changes to fully leverage its potential. Dependency management: Ensuring consistency and compatibility across shared dependencies can be challenging in Brownfield projects, as different parts of the application may rely on various dependency versions. Analyze your existing application: Identify the areas that would benefit most from Module Federation and prioritize them. Plan your refactoring: Develop a detailed plan to refactor your application and integrate Module Federation. Consider breaking the process into smaller, manageable tasks. Test thoroughly: Ensure you have a robust testing strategy in place to catch potential issues during the refactoring process. Greenfield development refers to building a new application from scratch, with Module Federation in mind from the beginning. This approach allows you to design and architect your application to take full advantage of Module Federation’s capabilities. Optimized architecture: Design your application architecture to fully leverage Module Federation from the start, maximizing its benefits. Easier dependency management: Plan and manage dependencies with Module Federation in mind, ensuring compatibility and consistency across your application. Faster implementation: Since you’re starting from scratch, there’s no need to refactor existing code, reducing potential complexity. Uncertain ROI: As you’re starting with a new application, it may be difficult to estimate the exact return on investment (ROI) of implementing Module Federation. Potential for over-optimization: In an effort to fully leverage Module Federation, you might over-optimize the architecture, which could lead to unnecessary complexity. Establish clear goals: Clearly define the objectives for your Greenfield project, including the expected benefits of implementing Module Federation. Design with scalability in mind: Ensure that your application architecture is flexible and scalable, allowing you to take full advantage of Module Federation as your project grows. Maintain simplicity: Avoid over-complicating your application design to maximize the benefits of Module Federation. Focus on simplicity and maintainability. Both Brownfield and Greenfield development approaches offer unique advantages and challenges when implementing Module Federation in your projects. The right choice for your project depends on your specific needs, resources, and goals. For existing applications that could benefit from Module Federation, Brownfield development may be the most suitable approach. However, be prepared for potential refactoring and architectural changes. On the other hand, if you’re starting a new project and want to build an application optimized for Module Federation from the outset, Greenfield development might be the better option. This approach allows you to create an architecture that fully leverages Module Federation capabilities while ensuring easier dependency management. Ultimately, the decision between Brownfield and Greenfield development depends on your project’s unique requirements and constraints. Carefully consider the advantages and challenges of each approach and adopt best practices to maximize the benefits of implementing Module Federation in your applications. With a thoughtful strategy in place, you can harness the power of Module Federation to create efficient, high-performance distributed systems.","title":"Brownfield vs. Greenfield Development with Module Federation","component":"mf-docs","version":"0.2","name":"brown-green","url":"/mf-docs/0.2/brown-green/","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"overview","id":1},{"text":"Brownfield Development with Module Federation","hash":"brownfield-development-with-module-federation","id":2},{"text":"Advantages","hash":"advantages","id":3},{"text":"Challenges","hash":"challenges","id":4},{"text":"Best Practices","hash":"best-practices","id":5},{"text":"Refactoring Example","hash":"refactoring-example","id":6},{"text":"Greenfield Development with Module Federation","hash":"greenfield-development-with-module-federation","id":7},{"text":"Advantages","hash":"advantages-2","id":8},{"text":"Challenges","hash":"challenges-2","id":9},{"text":"Best Practices","hash":"best-practices-2","id":10},{"text":"Conclusion","hash":"conclusion","id":11}]},"3":{"id":3,"text":"Cache busting is a technique used to prevent browsers from serving outdated or cached files. In the context of Module Federation, cache busting ensures that the latest versions of federated modules are loaded, even if a browser has cached an older version. One of the common techniques for cache invalidation in Module Federation involves appending a random query string to the end of the remoteEntry.js. This can be controlled to generate the same random string within a specific time window. Here’s an example of how you can implement this technique: // webpack.config.js plugins: [ new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: 'my-app', remotes: { 'my-remote-1': 'my-remote-1@[window.remote-1-domain]/remoteEntry.js?[getRandomString()]', // ... }, shared: {...} }), new ExternalTemplateRemotesPlugin(), //no parameter // ...otherPlugins ] In this example, the getRandomString() function will generate the same random string in a 5-minute window based on the current epoch time. This ensures better control over cache invalidation. An npm package named external-remotes-plugin has been published to simplify the implementation of this technique. You can find it on npm. Another effective technique for cache busting in Module Federation is including hashes in filenames. This ensures that any change in the file content will result in a new hash, forcing the browser to load the updated file. You can configure Webpack to include content hashes in the filenames as follows: // webpack.config.js module.exports = { output: { filename: '[name].[contenthash].js', publicPath: '/dist/', }, // ... }; In this configuration, [contenthash] is replaced with a hash of the content of the output file, ensuring that the file is reloaded whenever its content changes.

You will learn how this ownership model works, its benefits, and how to implement it within your projects. Component Level Ownership is a design pattern that allows individual components to be owned, managed, and versioned independently within a federated architecture. This approach empowers developers to create more maintainable and scalable applications by encapsulating the logic and dependencies of each component, reducing the risk of conflicts and promoting better collaboration. By leveraging Component Level Ownership, teams can work on different parts of the application simultaneously, enabling faster development cycles and increased agility. A good example of this would be the checkout team, they own everything around cart, payment, and quantities. A different team owns the shop experience, but that app needs an \"add to cart\" modal. Before federation, this meant old-school npm packages for the shared part or literally having to PR some component you own in someone else’s app. With Module Federation this is achievable at runtime in a very convenient way: import CartModal from \"checkoutTeam/components/cart-modal\" To achieve Component Level Ownership, each application needs to configure its Webpack Module Federation plugin with two options: name and exposes. The name option defines the unique identifier of the application, which will be used by other applications to reference it. The exposes option defines a mapping of keys to local files that contain the components to be exposed. For example: new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: \"app1\", exposes: { \"./Heroes\": \"./src/app/heroes/heroes.component.ts\", \"./Villains\": \"./src/app/villains/villains.component.ts\", }, }); This configuration tells Webpack that app1 exposes two components: Heroes and Villains, which are located in the specified files. These components can be imported by other applications using the syntax app1/ComponentName, where app1 is the name of the application and ComponentName is the key of the component in the exposes option. For example, another application called app2 can import and use the Heroes component from app1 like this: import { Heroes } from \"app1/Heroes\"; // use Heroes component in app2 To make this work, app2 also needs to configure its Webpack module federation plugin with two options: remotes and shared. The remotes option defines a mapping of names to URLs that point to the remote entry files of other applications. The remote entry file is a special file generated by Webpack that contains information about the exposed modules and how to load them. The shared option defines which modules are shared between the applications, such as vendor libraries or common dependencies. For example: new ModuleFederationPlugin({ remotes: { app1: \"app1@http://localhost:3000/remoteEntry.js\", }, shared: [\"@angular/core\", \"@angular/common\", \"@angular/router\"], }); This configuration tells Webpack that app2 can import modules from app1, which has a remote entry file at the specified URL. It also tells Webpack that both applications share some Angular modules, so they don’t need to load them twice. Improved Scalability: As your application grows, Component Level Ownership allows you to maintain a modular architecture, preventing tightly-coupled dependencies and reducing complexity by breaking down an application into smaller components, so you can better allocate resources and scale your application as needed. Maintainability: By encapsulating the logic and dependencies of each component, you can improve code readability and maintainability, making it easier to update and refactor components as needed. Additionally, assigning ownership to individual components simplifies the process of maintaining and updating the codebase too, as it is clear who is responsible for each component. Team Collaboration: Component Level Ownership enables better collaboration between teams by allowing them to work independently on their respective components, streamlining the development process and reducing the risk of conflicts. Performance: With dynamic imports and lazy loading, you can optimize your application’s performance by only loading the required components and their dependencies as needed. Component Level Ownership also comes with some challenges that need to be addressed: It requires careful design and documentation of the exposed components, as they need to have a clear interface and contract with other applications. It introduces some complexity and overhead in the configuration and orchestration of the applications, as they need to know where and how to find and load each other’s components. It may cause some compatibility issues or conflicts between different versions or implementations of the same component, especially if they are not properly isolated or scoped. There are some best practices and tools that can help us overcome these challenges and leverage Component Level Ownership effectively: Use standalone components that have minimal dependencies and side effects, and follow a single responsibility principle. This will make them easier to expose Use SCAM (Single Component Angular Module) pattern for shared components, which means creating a dedicated NgModule for each component that declares and exports it. This will make them easier to import and reuse by other applications. Use Dynamic Module Federation to load remote components on demand, instead of statically importing them. This will reduce the initial bundle size and improve performance. Use Angular’s built-in mechanisms to isolate and scope component styles, such as ViewEncapsulation and :host selector. This will prevent style conflicts and leakage between components. Use Angular’s dependency injection system to provide services and configuration to components, instead of relying on global variables or constants. This will make them more testable and adaptable to different environments³. Use custom elements or web components to wrap standalone components and expose them as standard HTML elements. This will make them interoperable with other frameworks or vanilla JavaScript. Component Level Ownership is a powerful concept that enables a federated architecture for Angular applications. It allows each application to expose and consume individual components from other applications, without requiring coordination or synchronization between teams or domains. It also reduces coupling and increases cohesion between applications, improves scalability and performance, and enhances user experience. However, Component Level Ownership also comes with some challenges that need to be addressed, such as design and documentation of the exposed components, configuration and orchestration of the applications, and compatibility and conflict resolution between different versions or implementations of the same component. To overcome these challenges, there are some best practices and tools that can help us leverage Component Level Ownership effectively, such as using standalone components that have minimal dependencies and side effects, using SCAM pattern for shared components, using Dynamic Module Federation to load remote components on demand, using Angular’s built-in mechanisms to isolate and scope component styles, using Angular’s dependency injection system to provide services and configuration to components, and using custom elements or web components to wrap standalone components and expose them as standard HTML elements.

With Composable Commerce, you can leverage best-of-breed solutions from different vendors and combine them into a unified shopping experience for your customers. In this guide, you will learn how to use Composable Commerce and Module Federation to create a modular and scalable e-commerce application. You will learn see how to: Figure out Composable Commerce concept; Benefits of Composable Commerce to e-commerce; Define the architecture and components of your application; Configure Webpack to enable Module Federation; Expose and consume modules from different bundles; Implement common e-commerce features such as product catalog, cart, checkout, and payment using Module Federation; Composable commerce is an approach to e-commerce development that follows the principles of microservices, domain-driven design and API-first design. It breaks down the monolithic e-commerce application into smaller, loosely coupled components that can be composed together to create a customized and adaptable user experience. Each component is responsible for a specific business domain or functionality, such as product catalog, shopping cart, checkout, payment, etc. These components communicate with each other through well-defined APIs and events. Composable commerce enables you to: Choose the best components for your business needs from different vendors or develop your own. Mix and match components from different sources and technologies without worrying about compatibility or integration issues. Replace or upgrade components without affecting the rest of the application or requiring downtime. Experiment with new features or functionalities without risking the stability of the application. Scale each component independently according to the demand and traffic. For example, suppose you have an e-commerce application that sells books online. You can use composable commerce to create your application from different components such as: A product catalog component that provides the data and UI for browsing and searching books by title, author, genre, etc. A shopping cart component that provides the data and UI for adding, removing and updating items in the cart. A checkout component that provides the data and UI for entering shipping and billing information, applying discounts and coupons, etc. A payment component that provides the data and UI for choosing and processing payment methods such as credit card, PayPal, etc. A review component that provides the data and UI for rating and reviewing books after purchase. Each component can be developed by a different team using a different technology stack. For example, the product catalog component can be developed using React and GraphQL, the shopping cart component can be developed using Angular and RESTful APIs, the checkout component can be developed using Vue and Firebase, etc. Each component can also be deployed and updated separately on different servers or domains. To compose your application from these components, you need to define how they interact with each other through APIs and events. For example, you can define an API for the product catalog component that exposes endpoints for querying books by various criteria. You can also define an event for the shopping cart component that emits a message when an item is added to or removed from the cart. You can then use these APIs and events to connect your components together and create a seamless user experience. By using Module Federation + Composable Commerce, you can achieve the following benefits: Faster time to market: You can reuse existing code and components from different sources without having to rebuild or redeploy them. You can also update or replace any component at any time without affecting the rest of the system. Greater flexibility and scalability: You can choose the best-of-breed vendors that provide the functionality you need for each business capability, such as product catalog, checkout, payment, etc. You can also scale each component independently according to your traffic and performance needs. Better customer experience: You can deliver consistent and engaging product experiences across multiple channels and touchpoints, such as web, mobile, social media, etc. You can also customize and optimize each component according to your customer preferences and behavior. For example, suppose you want to add a new feature to your e-commerce application that allows customers to create personalized book recommendations based on their preferences. You can use composable commerce to achieve this by: Reusing an existing component that provides a survey service to collect customer preferences. Developing a new component that provides a recommendation engine to generate book suggestions based on customer preferences. Integrating these components with your existing product catalog component using APIs and events. Deploying these components separately without affecting the rest of the application or requiring downtime. This way, you can deliver this new feature faster, cheaper and more reliably than if you had to modify your monolithic application. Module Federation + Composable Commerce works by breaking down your e-commerce solution into modular building blocks called Packaged Business Capabilities (PBCs). Each PBC represents a specific business function, such as product search, cart, reviews, etc. Each PBC can be deployed and scaled independently, and can communicate with other PBCs via APIs. You can choose the PBCs that suit your business requirements from different vendors or sources, or create your own PBCs if needed. You can then compose them together into a custom e-commerce application that meets your specific needs. Module federation is a feature of Webpack 5 that allows you to dynamically load modules from remote applications at runtime. It also enables you to share modules across different applications without duplicating code or creating dependencies. Module federation can help you migrate your existing e-commerce application to a composable commerce architecture by allowing you to: Split your monolithic application into smaller modules that can be loaded on demand by different applications. Create a shell application that acts as a container for loading and rendering different modules based on the user’s context and actions. Share common modules such as authentication, navigation, UI components, etc.across different applications to ensure consistency and avoid duplication. Leverage existing modules from third-party vendors or open source projects to enhance your application’s functionality and user experience. To use module federation, you need to: Configure Webpack 5 in each module and shell application to expose and consume remote modules using the ModuleFederationPlugin. Define the entry points, dependencies and fallbacks for each remote module using the exposes, remotes and shared options in the plugin configuration. Use dynamic imports or custom hooks to load and use remote modules in your shell or module applications. In this example, we have four PBCs: Product Catalog, Cart, Checkout and Payment. Each PBC is provided by a different vendor or source: Product Catalog: This PBC is provided by Akeneo, a product information management (PIM) platform that helps you manage and enrich your product data across multiple channels. Cart: This PBC is provided by Shopify, a leading e-commerce platform that offers a powerful cart functionality with features such as discounts, taxes, shipping rates, etc. Checkout: This PBC is provided by Sitecore, a digital experience platform that enables you to create personalized and optimized checkout experiences for your customers. Payment: This PBC is provided by Stripe, a payment platform that supports various payment methods, currencies, fraud prevention, etc. Each PBC is exposed as a remote module that can be loaded at runtime from its container. The containers are created using webpack’s Module Federation plugin, which allows sharing code between different builds. The containers are connected via APIs that enable data exchange and orchestration between the PBCs. The front-end application is built using React. The front-end application acts as the host that consumes the remote modules from the containers and renders them on the web page. The front-end application can also customize and extend the functionality of the remote modules if needed. To get started with Module Federation + Composable Commerce, you will need the following: A basic understanding of JavaScript, React and webpack A code editor of your choice A terminal or command-line interface Node.js and npm installed on your machine An account with each of the vendors or sources that provide the PBCs you want to use The following steps will guide you through creating a simple e-commerce application using Module Federation and Composable Commerce: Create a new folder for your project and navigate to it in your terminal or command-line interface. Initialize a new npm project by running npm init -y. Install webpack and its dependencies by running npm install webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin @module-federation/module-federation-plugin --save-dev. Create a webpack.config.js file in the root folder of your project and add the following code: // webpack.config.js const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require(\"html-webpack-plugin\"); const ModuleFederationPlugin = require(\"@module-federation/module-federation-plugin\"); module.exports = { mode: \"development\", devServer: { port: 3000, }, plugins: [ new HtmlWebpackPlugin({ template: \"./public/index.html\", }), new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: \"host\", remotes: { productCatalog: \"productCatalog@http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js\", cart: \"cart@http://localhost:3002/remoteEntry.js\", checkout: \"checkout@http://localhost:3003/remoteEntry.js\", payment: \"payment@http://localhost:3004/remoteEntry.js\", }, }), ], }; This code configures webpack to create a development server on port 3000 and to use Module Federation plugin to define the host application and the remote modules from the containers. Each remote module has a name and a URL that points to its container entry. Create a public folder in the root folder of your project and add an index.html file with the following code: Module Federation + Composable Commerce This code defines the HTML template for the host application and loads the main JavaScript bundle. Create a src folder in the root folder of your project and add an index.js file with the following code: // index.js import React from \"react\"; import ReactDOM from \"react-dom\"; import App from \"./App\"; ReactDOM.render(, document.getElementById(\"root\")); This code imports React and ReactDOM libraries and renders the App component on the web page. In the same src folder, create an App.js file with the following code: // App.js import React, { lazy, Suspense } from \"react\"; const ProductCatalog = lazy(() => import(\"productCatalog/ProductCatalog\")); const Cart = lazy(() => import(\"cart/Cart\")); const Checkout = lazy(() => import(\"checkout/Checkout\")); const Payment = lazy(() => import(\"payment/Payment\")); const App = () => { return ( Module Federation + Composable Commerce Loading...}> ); }; export default App; This code imports React and its lazy and Suspense features, which allow loading components asynchronously. It also imports the remote modules from the containers using their names defined in the webpack configuration. It then renders each component on the web page using Suspense to handle loading states. In your terminal or command-line interface, run npm start to start the development server and open your browser to http://localhost:3000. You should see a web page with a title and four loading messages. Congratulations! You have successfully created a host application that consumes remote modules from different containers using Module Federation + Composable Commerce. The next steps are to create each container application and expose its PBC as a remote module. For simplicity, we will use React for each container application, but you can use any framework or library of your choice. To create the Product Catalog container application, follow these steps: Create a new folder for your project and navigate to it in your terminal or command-line interface. Initialize a new npm project by running npm init -y. Install webpack and its dependencies by running npm install webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin @module-federation/module-federation-plugin --save-dev. Create a webpack.config.js file in the root folder of your project and add the following code: // webpack.config.js const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require(\"html-webpack-plugin\"); const ModuleFederationPlugin = require(\"@module-federation/module-federation-plugin\"); module.exports = { mode: \"development\", devServer: { port: 3001, }, plugins: [ new HtmlWebpackPlugin({ template: \"./public/index.html\", }), new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: \"productCatalog\", filename: \"remoteEntry.js\", exposes: { \"./ProductCatalog\": \"./src/ProductCatalog\", }, }), ], }; This code configures webpack to create a development server on port 3001 and to use Module Federation plugin to expose the Product Catalog PBC as a remote module with the name productCatalog and the filename remoteEntry.js. Create a public folder in the root folder of your project and add an index.html file with the following code: Product Catalog This code defines the HTML template for the container application and loads the remote entry JavaScript bundle. Create a src folder in the root folder of your project and add a ProductCatalog.js file with the following code: // ProductCatalog.js import React, { useState, useEffect } from \"react\"; import axios from \"axios\"; const ProductCatalog = () => { const [products, setProducts] = useState([]); useEffect(() => { // Fetch products from Akeneo PIM using its REST API // For simplicity, we hardcode the authentication token and the query parameters // In a real scenario, you would use a dynamic way to get these values const token = \"Bearer xxx\"; // Replace with your own token const query = { search: JSON.stringify({ enabled: [{ operator: \"=\", value: true }], }), scope: \"e-commerce\", locales: \"en_US\", limit: 10, with_attribute_options: true, }; axios .get(\"https://demo.akeneo.com/api/rest/v1/products\", { headers: { Authorization: token, Accept: \"application/json\", }, params: query, }) .then((response) => { // Extract the product data from the response const products = response.data._embedded.items.map((item) => { return { id: item.identifier, name: item.values.name.en_US[0].data, description: item.values.description.en_US[0].data, price: item.values.price[0].data[0].amount, image: item.values.images[0].data, }; }); // Update the state with the product data setProducts(products); }) .catch((error) => { // Handle errors console.error(error); }); }, []); return ( Product Catalog {products.map((product) => ( {product.name} {product.description} ${product.price} ))} ); }; export default ProductCatalog; This code imports React and its useState and useEffect hooks, as well as axios library for making HTTP requests. It defines a ProductCatalog component that fetches products from Akeneo PIM using its REST API² and renders them on the web page. In your terminal or command-line interface, run npm start to start the development server and open your browser to http://localhost:3001. You should see a web page with a title and a list of products. To create the Cart container application, follow these steps: Create a new folder for your project and navigate to it in your terminal or command-line interface.

Click on the Remove button in the Cart component to remove any product from the cart. Fill in the form in the Checkout component with your customer details and click on the Submit button to send them to Sitecore. Click on the Pay button in the Payment component to pay for your order using Stripe. Check the console logs in your browser’s developer tools to see the responses from Sitecore and Stripe. Congratulations! You have successfully created an e-commerce application using Module Federation + Composable Commerce. You have learned how to: Use webpack’s Module Federation plugin to expose and consume remote modules from different containers. Use React to create user interfaces for each PBC. Use axios to make HTTP requests to different APIs. Use Stripe to create and confirm payments. This guide has shown you how to create a simple e-commerce application using Module Federation + Composable Commerce. However, there are many more features and possibilities that you can explore with this approach. Here are some ideas for further improvement: Add more PBCs from different vendors or sources, such as product reviews, recommendations, loyalty programs, etc. Add more functionality and customization options to each PBC, such as filters, sorting, pagination, etc. Add more validation and error handling logic to each PBC, such as input validation, API error handling, etc. Add more security and authentication mechanisms to each PBC, such as HTTPS, CORS, CSRF protection, etc. Add more testing and debugging tools to each PBC, such as unit tests, integration tests, code coverage, logging, etc. Add more performance and optimization techniques to each PBC, such as caching, compression, minification, code splitting, lazy loading, etc. To ensure a successful migration to composable commerce with module federation, you should follow some best practices such as: Design your modules based on business domains or functionalities rather than technical layers or features. This will help you achieve high cohesion and low coupling among your modules. Define clear contracts and interfaces for your modules using APIs and events. This will help you ensure interoperability and compatibility among your modules. Use versioning and semantic versioning for your modules to manage changes and updates without breaking dependencies. Use feature flags or toggles to enable or disable features or functionalities in your modules without redeploying them. Use testing tools such as Jest or Cypress to test your modules individually and integrally. This will help you ensure quality and reliability of your modules. Use monitoring tools such as Sentry or New Relic to track performance, errors and usage of your modules. This will help you optimize and troubleshoot your modules. For example, suppose you want to update the cart component in the cart-app to show more information about the items such as quantity, price, subtotal, etc. You can use semantic versioning to indicate that this is a minor update that adds new functionality without breaking existing functionality. You can also use feature flags to enable this new functionality only for a subset of users for testing purposes. You can then deploy the updated cart-app without affecting the rest of the application or requiring downtime. Composable commerce with module federation is a powerful way to migrate your existing e-commerce application to a modular, flexible and scalable architecture. It allows you to leverage existing components from different sources or create your own components that can be composed together to create a customized user experience. It also enables you to update or replace components without affecting the rest of the application or requiring downtime. In this guide, you learned what composable commerce is, what benefits it provides for e-commerce businesses, how to use module federation to migrate your monolithic e-commerce application to a composable commerce architecture, what best practices you should follow, and how to use code examples to illustrate the steps.

With Composable Commerce, you can leverage best-of-breed solutions from different vendors and combine them into a unified shopping experience for your customers. In this guide, you will learn how to use Composable Commerce and Module Federation to create a modular and scalable e-commerce application. You will learn see how to: Figure out Composable Commerce concept; Benefits of Composable Commerce to e-commerce; Define the architecture and components of your application; Configure Webpack to enable Module Federation; Expose and consume modules from different bundles; Implement common e-commerce features such as product catalog, cart, checkout, and payment using Module Federation; Composable commerce is an approach to e-commerce development that follows the principles of microservices, domain-driven design and API-first design. It breaks down the monolithic e-commerce application into smaller, loosely coupled components that can be composed together to create a customized and adaptable user experience. Each component is responsible for a specific business domain or functionality, such as product catalog, shopping cart, checkout, payment, etc. These components communicate with each other through well-defined APIs and events. Composable commerce enables you to: Choose the best components for your business needs from different vendors or develop your own. Mix and match components from different sources and technologies without worrying about compatibility or integration issues. Replace or upgrade components without affecting the rest of the application or requiring downtime. Experiment with new features or functionalities without risking the stability of the application. Scale each component independently according to the demand and traffic. For example, suppose you have an e-commerce application that sells books online. You can use composable commerce to create your application from different components such as: A product catalog component that provides the data and UI for browsing and searching books by title, author, genre, etc. A shopping cart component that provides the data and UI for adding, removing and updating items in the cart. A checkout component that provides the data and UI for entering shipping and billing information, applying discounts and coupons, etc. A payment component that provides the data and UI for choosing and processing payment methods such as credit card, PayPal, etc. A review component that provides the data and UI for rating and reviewing books after purchase. Each component can be developed by a different team using a different technology stack. For example, the product catalog component can be developed using React and GraphQL, the shopping cart component can be developed using Angular and RESTful APIs, the checkout component can be developed using Vue and Firebase, etc. Each component can also be deployed and updated separately on different servers or domains. To compose your application from these components, you need to define how they interact with each other through APIs and events. For example, you can define an API for the product catalog component that exposes endpoints for querying books by various criteria. You can also define an event for the shopping cart component that emits a message when an item is added to or removed from the cart. You can then use these APIs and events to connect your components together and create a seamless user experience. By using Module Federation + Composable Commerce, you can achieve the following benefits: Faster time to market: You can reuse existing code and components from different sources without having to rebuild or redeploy them. You can also update or replace any component at any time without affecting the rest of the system. Greater flexibility and scalability: You can choose the best-of-breed vendors that provide the functionality you need for each business capability, such as product catalog, checkout, payment, etc. You can also scale each component independently according to your traffic and performance needs. Better customer experience: You can deliver consistent and engaging product experiences across multiple channels and touchpoints, such as web, mobile, social media, etc. You can also customize and optimize each component according to your customer preferences and behavior. For example, suppose you want to add a new feature to your e-commerce application that allows customers to create personalized book recommendations based on their preferences. You can use composable commerce to achieve this by: Reusing an existing component that provides a survey service to collect customer preferences. Developing a new component that provides a recommendation engine to generate book suggestions based on customer preferences. Integrating these components with your existing product catalog component using APIs and events. Deploying these components separately without affecting the rest of the application or requiring downtime. This way, you can deliver this new feature faster, cheaper and more reliably than if you had to modify your monolithic application. Module Federation + Composable Commerce works by breaking down your ecommerce solution into modular building blocks called Packaged Business Capabilities (PBCs). Each PBC represents a specific business function, such as product search, cart, reviews, etc. Each PBC can be deployed and scaled independently, and can communicate with other PBCs via APIs. You can choose the PBCs that suit your business requirements from different vendors or sources, or create your own PBCs if needed. You can then compose them together into a custom ecommerce application that meets your specific needs. Module federation is a feature of Webpack 5 that allows you to dynamically load modules from remote applications at runtime. It also enables you to share modules across different applications without duplicating code or creating dependencies. Module federation can help you migrate your existing e-commerce application to a composable commerce architecture by allowing you to: Split your monolithic application into smaller modules that can be loaded on demand by different applications. Create a shell application that acts as a container for loading and rendering different modules based on the user’s context and actions. Share common modules such as authentication, navigation, UI components, etc.across different applications to ensure consistency and avoid duplication. Leverage existing modules from third-party vendors or open source projects to enhance your application’s functionality and user experience. To use module federation, you need to: Configure Webpack 5 in each module and shell application to expose and consume remote modules using the ModuleFederationPlugin. Define the entry points, dependencies and fallbacks for each remote module using the exposes, remotes and shared options in the plugin configuration. Use dynamic imports or custom hooks to load and use remote modules in your shell or module applications. In this example, you have four bundles: Shell: This is the main bundle that provides the layout and navigation of your application. It also acts as the host for the other bundles and consumes their modules. Catalog: This bundle exposes a product list component that displays the products from a product catalog service. Cart: This bundle exposes a cart component that displays the items in the shopping cart and allows the user to update or remove them. It also communicates with a cart service to persist the cart data. Checkout: This bundle exposes a checkout component that guides the user through the checkout process. It also communicates with a checkout service to handle the payment and order confirmation. You can follow these steps to migrate your e-commerce application using these bundles: Create four separate module applications for each bundle: shell-app, catalog-app, cart-app and checkout-app. Each module application should contain the logic, data and UI components related to its bundle. For example, the catalog-app should contain the product catalog service, the product list component, etc. // src/ProductList.js import React from \"react\"; import { useQuery } from \"@apollo/client\"; import { GET_ALL_BOOKS } from \"./queries\"; function ProductList() { const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_ALL_BOOKS); if (loading) return Loading...; if (error) return Error: {error.message}; const { books } = data; return ( Books {books.map((book) => ( {book.title} ))} ); } export default ProductList; Create a shell application that will act as a container for loading and rendering different module applications based on the user’s context and actions. The shell application should contain the common modules such as authentication, navigation, UI components, etc.that are shared across all bundles. The shell application should also contain a router that will determine which module application to load based on the URL path. // src/Shell.js import React from \"react\"; import { BrowserRouter as Router } from \"react-router-dom\"; import Header from \"./Header\"; import Footer from \"./Footer\"; function Shell() { return ( {/* render module applications based on route */} ); } export default Shell; The previous chapter was: Configure Webpack 5 in each module and shell application using the ModuleFederationPlugin. For example, in the catalog-app, you should expose the product list component as a remote module using the exposes option: // webpack.config.js const ModuleFederationPlugin = require(\"webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin\"); module.exports = { // ... plugins: [ new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: \"catalog\", filename: \"remoteEntry.js\", exposes: { \"./ProductList\": \"./src/ProductList\", }, shared: { // specify shared dependencies react: { singleton: true }, \"react-router-dom\": { singleton: true }, \"@apollo/client\": { singleton: true }, }, }), ], }; In the shell application, you should consume the product list component as a remote module using the remotes option: // webpack.config.js const ModuleFederationPlugin = require(\"webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin\"); module.exports = { // ... plugins: [ new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: \"shell\", filename: \"remoteEntry.js\", remotes: { catalog: \"catalog@http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js\", }, shared: { // specify shared dependencies react: { singleton: true }, \"react-router-dom\": { singleton: true }, }, }), ], }; Use dynamic imports or custom hooks to load and use remote modules in your shell or module applications. For example, in the shell application, you can use React.lazy() to load and render the product list component from the catalog-app when the user navigates to /products: // src/Shell.js import React from \"react\"; import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from \"react-router-dom\"; import Header from \"./Header\"; import Footer from \"./Footer\"; const ProductList = React.lazy(() => import(\"catalog/ProductList\") ); function Shell() { return ( {/* render module applications based on route */} Loading...}> {/* render other routes */} ); } export default Shell; Repeat steps 3 and 4 for other module applications such as cart-app and checkout-app. For example, in the cart-app, you can expose the cart component as a remote module: // webpack.config.js const ModuleFederationPlugin = require(\"webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin\"); module.exports = { // ... plugins: [ new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: \"cart\", filename: \"remoteEntry.js\", exposes: { \"./Cart\": \"./src/Cart\", }, shared: { // specify shared dependencies react: { singleton: true }, \"react-router-dom\": { singleton: true }, axios: { singleton: true }, }, }), ], }; In the shell application, you can consume the cart component as a remote module: // webpack.config.js const ModuleFederationPlugin = require(\"webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin\"); module.exports = { // ... plugins: [ new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: \"shell\", filename: \"remoteEntry.js\", remotes: { catalog: \"catalog@http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js\", cart: \"cart@http://localhost:3002/remoteEntry.js\", }, shared: { // specify shared dependencies react: { singleton: true }, \"react-router-dom\": { singleton: true }, }, }), ], }; And use React.lazy() to load and render the cart component from the cart-app when the user navigates to /cart: // src/Shell.js import React from \"react\"; import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from \"react-router-dom\"; import Header from \"./Header\"; import Footer from \"./Footer\"; const ProductList = React.lazy(() => import(\"catalog/ProductList\") ); const Cart = React.lazy(() => import(\"cart/Cart\") ); function Shell() { return ( {/* render module applications based on route */} Loading...}> Loading...}> {/* render other routes */} ); } export default Shell; Deploy each module and shell application separately on different servers or domains. For example, you can deploy catalog-app on http://localhost:3001/, cart-app on http://localhost:3002/, and shell-app on http://localhost:3003/. Test your composable commerce application by accessing http://localhost:3003/ in your browser. To ensure a successful migration to composable commerce with module federation, you should follow some best practices such as: Design your modules based on business domains or functionalities rather than technical layers or features.

We will also discuss how they can enhance the flexibility and control of your Webpack configuration, empowering you to create more sophisticated applications Delegate modules have been introduced to tackle a longstanding challenge in the module federation space - dynamic remotes. These modules offer a more streamlined and scalable way to control the \"glue\" code that connects remote applications, without sacrificing the advantages of Webpack. To get more familiar with the concept of Dynamic Remotes, we suggest reading a dedicated documentation page: Dynamic Remotes Traditionally, managing dynamic remotes involved injecting a script using the low-level module federation API, which resulted in losing many of Webpack’s features. With delegate modules, you can now instruct Webpack that a remote entry is a code within the Webpack build itself, enabling you to bundle various entry-point logic and export back a promise that resolves to a federated remote. Compared to using the promise new Promise syntax, delegate modules are bundled into Webpack and can utilize require and import statements. This makes them ideal for handling complex requirements such as loading remote modules or customizing the federation API. However, it’s important to note that delegate modules are an advanced feature and may not be necessary for the majority of users. Delegate modules provide several benefits when compared to the older implementation involving the \"promise new promise\" syntax. By adopting delegate modules, you can: Gain fine-grained control over the glue code part of when Webpack requests a remote and how it retrieves the container, without the brittleness and restrictions of traditional methods. Bundle a diverse range of entry point logic, effectively creating a framework-like structure for managing federated remotes. Access various methods for retrieving containers, including HTTP, file systems, or even databases, without waiting for support from the module federation team. Implement robust middleware between the connection points of Webpack graphs, gaining unprecedented control over graphs and their behavior. Seamlessly integrate with different environments, such as edge workers or server-side applications, without the need for complex top-to-bottom implementation. One of the primary use cases for delegate modules is handling fallbacks. In scenarios where a remote is not available when expected, you can use delegate modules to recover the federated remote seamlessly. This middleware approach allows you to redirect Webpack to retrieve alternative code while maintaining the same import interface, resulting in a more resilient application. Delegate modules can also be employed for server-side integration. They can be used to fetch remote entries from various sources, such as databases or file systems, without relying solely on HTTP. This approach offers enhanced security and control over user-based access and data retrieval, allowing for more granular access control and data protection. Delegate modules can support ESI and KV integration on edge networks by fetching HTML and returning it as React components. This approach enables a more agnostic method for distributed systems without requiring a complete top-to-bottom implementation for edge deployment. By leveraging delegate modules, you can simplify the process of implementing edge-side applications and enhance their performance. A delegate module is a federated module that does not contain any code of its own, but instead delegates the loading and execution of another module to a different remote build. The delegate module acts as a placeholder for the actual module until it is requested by the application. The delegate module has two main properties: remote and remoteType. The remote property specifies the name of the remote build that contains the actual module. The remoteType property specifies the type of the remote build, such as var, script, module, etc. The delegate module also has a get method that returns a promise that resolves to the actual module. The get method takes care of loading the remote build and requesting the actual module from it. The delegate module can be exposed by any remote build using the exposes option in the Module Federation plugin configuration. For example, if you have a remote build named app1 that exposes a delegate module named delegate, you can configure it like this: // webpack.config.js for app1 module.exports = { // ... plugins: [ new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: \"app1\", filename: \"remoteEntry.js\", exposes: { \"./delegate\": \"./src/delegate.js\", }, }), ], }; The src/delegate.js file contains the code for the delegate module. For example, if you want to delegate the loading of a module named foo from another remote build named app2, you can write it like this: // src/delegate.js for app1 import { get } from \"webpack/container/entry/dynamic-remotes\"; export default { // Specify the name and type of the remote build remote: \"app2\", remoteType: \"var\", // Define a getter function that returns a promise for the actual module get: () => get(\"app2/foo\"), }; The get function uses the get function from the webpack/container/entry/dynamic-remotes module, which is a helper function provided by webpack for loading dynamic remotes. It takes the name of the remote build and the name of the exposed module as arguments, and returns a promise that resolves to the actual module. The delegate module can then be consumed by any application that has access to the remote build that exposes it. For example, if you have an application named host that consumes the delegate module from app1, you can configure it like this: // webpack.config.js for host module.exports = { // ... plugins: [ new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: \"host\", remotes: { // Specify the URL of the remote build that exposes the delegate module app1: \"app1@http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js\", }, }), ], }; The application can then import and use the delegate module like any other federated module. For example: // src/index.js for host import(\"./bootstrap\"); async function bootstrap() { // Import the delegate module from app1 const delegate = await import(\"app1/delegate\"); // Use the delegate module to get the actual module from app2 const foo = await delegate.get(); // Use the actual module as usual foo.doSomething(); } bootstrap(); As you can see, the application does not need to know anything about the remote build that contains the actual module. It only needs to know the name of the remote build that exposes the delegate module. The delegate module takes care of loading and resolving the actual module dynamically. Delegate modules are useful when you want to share code across multiple remote builds without having to expose them directly. For example, you may have a common library that is used by several remote builds, but you don’t want to expose it as a federated module because it may change frequently or have different versions. Instead, you can expose a delegate module that delegates the loading of the common library to another remote build that is responsible for maintaining and updating it. To use delegate modules, you need to follow these steps: Create a remote build that contains the actual module you want to share. For example, if you have a common library named foo, you can create a remote build named app2 that exposes it as a federated module. Create a delegate module that delegates the loading of the actual module to the remote build that contains it. For example, if you want to delegate the loading of foo from app2, you can create a delegate module named delegate in another remote build named app1. Expose the delegate module as a federated module in the remote build that contains it. For example, you can expose delegate as a federated module in app1. Consume the delegate module from any application or remote build that has access to the remote build that exposes it. For example, you can consume delegate from an application named host or another remote build named app3. By using delegate modules, you can achieve several benefits: You can avoid duplication and version conflicts between federated modules. For example, if you have multiple remote builds that depend on foo, you don’t need to expose and load foo multiple times. You only need to load it once through the delegate module. You can decouple your remote builds from each other. For example, if you change or update foo, you don’t need to rebuild or redeploy your other remote builds that depend on it. You only need to rebuild or redeploy app2, and the other remote builds will get the latest version of foo through the delegate module. You can abstract away the details of your remote builds from your consumers. For example, if you want to change the name or type of your remote build that contains foo, you don’t need to update your consumers that use it. You only need to update your delegate module that points to it. Delegate modules are powerful and flexible, but they also come with some caveats and limitations that you need to be aware of when using them. Delegate modules introduce an extra level of indirection and complexity in your Module Federation setup. You need to make sure that your consumers know how to access and use your delegate modules correctly, and that your delegate modules point to the right remote builds and modules. Delegate modules rely on dynamic remotes, which means that they load remote builds at runtime instead of at compile time. This may have some implications for performance and security. For example, you may need to add some caching and prefetching strategies to improve loading speed, and some authentication and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access. Delegate modules may not work well with some types of remote builds or modules. For example, if your remote build uses a different bundler than webpack, or if your module uses some non-standard features or syntax, you may encounter some compatibility issues or errors when loading them through delegate modules. Therefore, before using delegate modules, you should carefully evaluate your use case and requirements, and weigh the pros and cons of using them versus other alternatives. Delegate modules are a special type of federated module that allow you to dynamically load and resolve other modules from different remote builds at runtime. They enable you to share code across multiple applications without having to rebuild or redeploy them every time you make a change. In this guide, you learned everything you need to know about delegate modules, how they work, how to use them, and what benefits they bring to your Module Federation setup. You also learned some of the caveats and limitations of using delegate modules, and what to watch out for when using them. Delegate modules are a powerful and flexible feature of webpack that can help you improve your code sharing and decoupling across multiple applications. However, they are not a silver bullet, and they may not suit every use case or scenario. Therefore, you should always test and verify your Module Federation setup before deploying it to production.

This guide is intended to provide elaborate and understandable instructions for implementing dynamic remotes in your projects. Dynamic remotes enable you to deploy the same micro frontend application in testing, staging, and production environments. They also support on-premise, cloud, and hybrid deployments simultaneously, and allow you to scale multiple teams working on different parts of the architecture. In this guide, we will cover four ways to use dynamic remotes: Environment variables Webpack plugin external-remotes-plugin Promise-based dynamic remotes Dynamic remote containers Environment variables provide a straightforward way to use dynamic remotes by replacing localhost in your Webpack config with environment variables. module.exports = (env) => ({ // ... plugins: [ new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: \"Host\", remotes: { RemoteA: `RemoteA@${env.A_URL}/remoteEntry.js`, RemoteB: `RemoteB@${env.B_URL}/remoteEntry.js`, }, }), ], }); This approach is simple but requires building a new version for each environment to update the URLs, which may not be ideal for enterprise use cases and multiple deployment models. The external-remotes-plugin, developed by Zack Jackson, allows you to resolve URLs at runtime using templating. By defining window.appAUrl and window.appBUrl within your application before loading any code from remote applications, you gain the flexibility to define your URLs as needed. plugins: [ new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: \"Host\", remotes: { RemoteA: \"RemoteA@[window.appAUrl]/remoteEntry.js\", RemoteB: \"RemoteB@[window.appBUrl]/remoteEntry.js\", }, }), new ExternalTemplateRemotesPlugin(), ], All you need to do is define window.appAUrl and window.appBUrl within our application before you load any code from the remote applications. Now you have the flexibility to define our URLs however you want. For example, you could maintain a map of the host URLs to remote URLs for each environment, use server-side rendering to allow the backend to define the URLs, create a custom configuration management service, and many other methods. This approach is fully dynamic and would solve our use cases, but there is still a slight limitation with this approach. We do not have complete control over the loading lifecycle. Module Federation allows you to define remote URLs as promises instead of URL strings. You can use any promise as long as it fits the get/init interface defined by Module Federation. This method offers more control over the loading process but may be difficult to debug or maintain due to the stringified code in the configuration file. // Webpack config: module.exports = { // ... plugins: [ new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: \"Host\", remotes: { RemoteA: `promise new Promise(${fetchRemoteA.toString()})`, }, }), ], }; // Fetch Remote A dynamically: const fetchRemoteA = (resolve) => { // We define a script tag to use the browser for fetching the remoteEntry.js file const script = document.createElement(\"script\"); script.src = window.appAUrl; // This could be defined anywhere // When the script is loaded we need to resolve the promise back to Module Federation script.onload = () => { // The script is now loaded on window using the name defined within the remote const module = { get: (request) => window.RemoteA.get(request), init: (arg) => { try { return window.RemoteA.init(arg); } catch (e) { console.log(\"Remote A has already been loaded\"); } }, }; } resolve(module); } // Lastly we inject the script tag into the document's head to trigger the script load document.head.appendChild(script); } In this approach, we create a new script tag and inject it into the DOM to fetch the remote JavaScript file. window.appAUrl contains the URL for the remote app. While this method provides control over the loading lifecycle, it is not the easiest to debug or maintain since it involves stringified code within the configuration file. Dynamic remote containers allow you to load remote applications programmatically without defining any URLs in your Webpack configuration. This enables developers to work on new remote applications that may not yet be defined in the host application or allow partners and customers to inject their remote modules into their deployment of your app. Remove the remotes field from the ModuleFederationPlugin configuration: plugins: [ new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: \"Host\", remotes: {}, }), ], Before loading any remote apps, fetch the remote module using a dynamic script tag and manually initialize the remote container: (async () => { // Initializes the shared scope. Fills it with known provided modules from this build and all remotes await __webpack_init_sharing__(\"default\"); const container = window.someContainer; // or get the container somewhere else // Initialize the container, it may provide shared modules await container.init(__webpack_share_scopes__.default); const module = await container.get(\"./module\"); })(); Here, container refers to a remote app configured in the remotes field in the host app’s Webpack configuration, and module refers to one of the items defined in the exposes field in the remote app’s Webpack configuration. By injecting a script tag to fetch the remote container and storing it in window.someContainer, you can ensure the code resolves to the same get/init pattern used in earlier examples. To use one of the modules exposed by the remote app, call container.get(moduleName) as demonstrated in the example above. Using dynamic remotes, you can deploy your micro frontend to fetch remote applications from any URL, allowing for deployment to multiple test environments, on-premises, or in the cloud. Developers can choose whether to use production versions of other remote applications or introduce new ones dynamically. The four methods discussed in this guide are: Environment Variables Webpack External Remotes Plugin Promise-Based Dynamic Remotes Dynamic Remote Containers Each method has its advantages and limitations. Choose the one that best suits your project’s requirements and complexity.","title":"Using Dynamic Remotes in Module Federation","component":"mf-docs","version":"0.2","name":"dynamic-remotes","url":"/mf-docs/0.2/dynamic-remotes/","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"overview","id":1},{"text":"Environment Variables","hash":"environment-variables","id":2},{"text":"Implementation","hash":"implementation","id":3},{"text":"Advantages and Limitations","hash":"advantages-and-limitations","id":4},{"text":"Webpack External Remotes Plugin","hash":"webpack-external-remotes-plugin","id":5},{"text":"Implementation","hash":"implementation-2","id":6},{"text":"Advantages and Limitations","hash":"advantages-and-limitations-2","id":7},{"text":"Promise-Based Dynamic Remotes","hash":"promise-based-dynamic-remotes","id":8},{"text":"Implementation","hash":"implementation-3","id":9},{"text":"Webpack Configuration","hash":"webpack-configuration","id":10},{"text":"Fetching Remote A Dynamically","hash":"fetching-remote-a-dynamically","id":11},{"text":"Advantages and Limitations","hash":"advantages-and-limitations-3","id":12},{"text":"Dynamic Remote Containers","hash":"dynamic-remote-containers","id":13},{"text":"Implementation","hash":"implementation-4","id":14},{"text":"Summary and Recommendations","hash":"summary-and-recommendations","id":15}]},"9":{"id":9,"text":"In this page, you will find a list of examples and demos that showcase how module federation works and how you can use it for various scenarios.

We will build two separate Single Page Applications (SPAs) that use Module Federation to share components during runtime. First, we need to set up our environment. We will be using a yarn mono-repo structure for simplicity. Start by creating a new project folder with the following package.json to allow us to run our two SPAs at the same time: { \"name\": \"federation-example\", \"private\": true, \"workspaces\": [ \"packages/*\" ], \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"wsrun --parallel start\", \"build\": \"yarn workspaces run build\", \"dev\": \"wsrun --parallel dev\" }, \"devDependencies\": { \"wsrun\": \"^5.2.0\" } } Next, create two directories for our SPAs to live in under a new packages directory called application-a and application-b. These will respectively contain the following package.json files: // packages/application-a/package.json { \"name\": \"application-a\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"private\": true, \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"serve dist -p 3001\", \"build\": \"webpack --mode production\", \"dev\": \"concurrently \\\"webpack --watch\\\" \\\"serve dist -p 3001\\\"\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"react\": \"^16.13.1\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.13.1\" }, \"devDependencies\": { \"@babel/core\": \"^7.8.6\", \"@babel/preset-react\": \"^7.8.3\", \"babel-loader\": \"^8.0.6\", \"concurrently\": \"^5.1.0\", \"html-webpack-plugin\": \"git://github.com/ScriptedAlchemy/html-webpack-plugin#master\", \"serve\": \"^11.3.0\", \"webpack\": \"git://github.com/webpack/webpack.git#dev-1\", \"webpack-cli\": \"^3.3.11\" } } // packages/application-b/package.json { \"name\": \"application-b\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"private\": true, \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"serve dist -p 3002\", \"build\": \"webpack --mode production\", \"dev\": \"concurrently \\\"webpack --watch\\\" \\\"serve dist -p 3002\\\"\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"react\": \"^16.13.1\", \"react-dom\": \"^16.13.1\" }, \"devDependencies\": { \"@babel/core\": \"^7.8.6\", \"@babel/preset-react\": \"^7.8.3\", \"babel-loader\": \"^8.0.6\", \"concurrently\": \"^5.1.0\", \"html-webpack-plugin\": \"git://github.com/ScriptedAlchemy/html-webpack-plugin#master\", \"serve\": \"^11.3.0\", \"webpack\": \"git://github.com/webpack/webpack.git#dev-1\", \"webpack-cli\": \"^3.3.11\" } } Install the dependencies with yarn. Next, we need to bootstrap our SPA React applications. Create a src directory in each of our packages that contain the following files: // packages/application-{a,b}/src/index.js import('./bootstrap'); // packages/application-{a,b}/src/bootstrap.jsx import React from 'react'; import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'; import App from './app'; ReactDOM.render(, document.getElementById('root')); We also need a public directory in each of the packages with the following HTML template: // packages/application-{a,b}/public/index.html Now we can implement our two app.jsx files for each application that will house our shared components: // packages/application-a/src/app.jsx const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin'); const ModuleFederationPlugin = require('webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin'); const mode = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'production'; module.exports = { mode, entry: './src/index', devtool: 'source-map', optimization: { minimize: mode === 'production', }, resolve: { extensions: ['.jsx', '.js', '.json'], }, module: { rules: [ { test: /\\.jsx?$/, loader: require.resolve('babel-loader'), options: { presets: [require.resolve('@babel/preset-react')], }, }, ], }, plugins: [ new HtmlWebpackPlugin({ template: './public/index.html', }), ], }; From the root of the application, you should now be able to access your two SPAs on http://localhost:3001 and http://localhost:3002 when running yarn dev. Now that we have two independent SPAs running, let’s go ahead and make each of the SPAs a Federated Container as well as Consumer. We accomplish this by utilizing the new ModuleFederationPlugin that is part of the Webpack 5 Core. We’ll start by adding the ModuleFederationPlugin to Application A: // packages/application-a/webpack.config.js const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin'); const ModuleFederationPlugin = require('webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin'); const mode = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'production'; module.exports = { mode, entry: './src/index', output: { publicPath: 'http://localhost:3001/', // New }, devtool: 'source-map', optimization: { minimize: mode === 'production', }, resolve: { extensions: ['.jsx', '.js', '.json'], }, module: { rules: [ { test: /\\.jsx?$/, loader: require.resolve('babel-loader'), options: { presets: [require.resolve('@babel/preset-react')], }, }, ], }, plugins: [ // New new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: 'application_a', library: { type: 'var', name: 'application_a' }, filename: 'remoteEntry.js', exposes: { 'SayHelloFromA': './src/app', }, remotes: { 'application_b': 'application_b', }, shared: ['react', 'react-dom'], }), new HtmlWebpackPlugin({ template: './public/index.html', }), ], }; This specifies that Application A exposes its App component to the world as a Federated Module called SayHelloFromA, while whenever you import from application_b, those modules should come from Application B at runtime. We will do the same thing for Application B, specifying that it exposes its App component as SayHelloFromB and whenever we import from application_a, those modules should come from Application A at runtime: // packages/application-b/webpack.config.js const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin'); const ModuleFederationPlugin = require('webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin'); const mode = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'production'; module.exports = { mode, entry: './src/index', output: { publicPath: 'http://localhost:3002/', // New }, devtool: 'source-map', optimization: { minimize: mode === 'production', }, resolve: { extensions: ['.jsx', '.js', '.json'], }, module: { rules: [ { test: /\\.jsx?$/, loader: require.resolve('babel-loader'), options: { presets: [require.resolve('@babel/preset-react')], }, }, ], }, plugins: [ // New new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: 'application_b', library: { type: 'var', name: 'application_b' }, filename: 'remoteEntry.js', exposes: { 'SayHelloFromB': './src/app', }, remotes: { 'application_a': 'application_a', }, shared: ['react', 'react-dom'], }), new HtmlWebpackPlugin({ template: './public/index.html', }), ], }; The last step before we can start to utilize the exposed components is to specify for the runtime where the Remote Entries for the Containers you wish to consume are located. We do this by adding a script tag to the HTML template of the remotes you wish to consume. // packages/application-a/public/index.html // packages/application-b/public/index.html The remote entry files are tiny mappings for Webpack to resolve the individually imported modules without transferring unnecessary information. They are also responsible for enabling the sharing of libraries that the packages use, in this case, when Application A requests Application B’s SayHelloFromB component, we do not send the React or ReactDOM over the wire as Application A already has a copy of it. Now that our two SPA applications are Container Hosts and Consumers, we can start to consume the shared components. In the Цebpack config we had specified the names of the containers as application_a and application_b, so that is where we will import the components from. Starting with Application A, we can render the SayHelloFromB component like so from within the bootstrap file: // packages/application-a/src/bootstrap.jsx import React from 'react'; import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'; import SayHelloFromB from 'application_b/SayHelloFromB'; import App from './app'; ReactDOM.render( <> , document.getElementById('root') ); Application B will look very similar, just importing from application_a instead: // packages/application-b/src/bootstrap.jsx import React from 'react'; import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'; import SayHelloFromA from 'application_a/SayHelloFromA'; import App from './app'; ReactDOM.render( <> , document.getElementById('root') ); Looking at the network log for Application A you will see that we load two files from Application B, the remoteEntry.js file, then the 977.js that contains the SayHelloFromB component. Visiting Application B for the first time, you’ll notice we have already cached the remoteEntries for both Application B and Application A. Congratulations! You have just created your first Webpack 5 Federated projects. Now go out and build something awesome!","title":"Module Federation: Getting Started: The Practical Part","component":"mf-docs","version":"0.2","name":"getting-started-practical","url":"/mf-docs/0.2/getting-started-practical/","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"introduction","id":1},{"text":"Setting Up the Environment","hash":"setting-up-the-environment","id":2},{"text":"Bootstrapping the SPAs","hash":"bootstrapping-the-spas","id":3},{"text":"Start Federating","hash":"start-federating","id":4},{"text":"Consuming Federated Components","hash":"consuming-federated-components","id":5},{"text":"Additional Notes","hash":"additional-notes","id":6},{"text":"Conclusion","hash":"conclusion","id":7}]},"11":{"id":11,"text":"Module Federation is a concept that allows developers to share code and resources across multiple JavaScript applications, or micro-frontends. In a traditional web application, all the code for a single page is usually contained within a single codebase. This can lead to monolithic applications that are difficult to maintain and scale. With Module Federation, code can be split into smaller, independently deployable modules that can be loaded on demand when they are needed. This allows micro-frontends to be developed and deployed independently, which reduces coordination between teams and allows for faster development cycles. At its core, Module Federation is based on the idea of remote loading of JavaScript modules. This means that instead of having all the code for a single application loaded at once, the code can be split into smaller, independently deployable modules that can be loaded on demand when they are needed. Module Federation is implemented using the Webpack module bundler. Webpack is a tool that allows developers to bundle JavaScript modules into a single file that can be loaded by a web browser. With Module Federation, Webpack is extended to allow modules to be loaded from other applications, rather than just from within the same application. To use Module Federation, developers need to configure their Webpack builds to expose certain modules to other applications and to consume modules from other applications. This can be done using the exposes and remotes options in the Webpack configuration. The exposes option is used to expose certain modules from an application to other applications. This tells Webpack which modules should be available to other applications when they are loaded remotely. The remotes option is used to consume modules from other applications. This tells Webpack which modules should be loaded remotely from other applications when they are needed. Once the Webpack configurations for each application have been set up, the applications can be deployed independently. When a user visits a page that includes multiple micro-frontends, the micro-frontends will dynamically load the code they need from other micro-frontends using the exposes and remotes options. In summary, Module Federation allows developers to share code and resources across micro-frontends, which reduces duplication and improves code maintainability. By allowing micro-frontends to be developed and deployed independently, Module Federation reduces the need for coordination between teams and allows for faster development cycles. Having built a necessary theoretical foundation of Module Federation, let us now pivot towards the practical aspect and embark on the journey of actual implementation, exploring the possibilities Module Federation has to offer: Getting Started with Module Federation","title":"What is Module Federation?","component":"mf-docs","version":"0.2","name":"getting-started","url":"/mf-docs/0.2/getting-started/","titles":[{"text":"Conclusion","hash":"conclusion","id":1}]},"12":{"id":12,"text":"Module Federation is a relatively new feature in the world of web development, first introduced in Webpack 5. In this guide, we’ll explore the history of Module Federation, including its origins, evolution, and the major milestones that led to its development. The idea of sharing code between multiple applications is not a new one. In fact, it has been a common practice in software development for many years. However, the rise of microservices and the need for highly modular and scalable architectures in web development created a new demand for code sharing across multiple applications. The first attempts to solve this problem involved using iframes or server-side includes to embed code from one application into another. However, these approaches had significant limitations in terms of performance, flexibility, and security. In 2020, Webpack 5 was released with a new feature called \"Module Federation\". This feature was a significant step forward in the evolution of code sharing in web development. Module Federation allowed developers to share entire modules between multiple applications, not just Redux-related code. This was accomplished by extending the Webpack module bundler to support remote loading of modules and using a runtime called the \"Module Federation Runtime\" to handle the loading and dependency resolution of remote modules. Since its introduction in Webpack 5, Module Federation has continued to evolve and improve. In Webpack 5, it was limited to sharing modules between applications built with Webpack. However, in Webpack 5.1, support was added for sharing modules between applications built with different module bundlers, such as Rollup or Parcel. In addition, the community has developed a number of tools and plugins to extend the capabilities of Module Federation, including the \"Module Federation Plugin\" for Next.js, and the \"Federation Plugin\" for Snowpack. Module Federation has the potential to significantly change the way we approach code sharing in web development. As it continues to evolve and improve, it is likely that we will see more widespread adoption and integration with other tools and frameworks. Some potential future directions for Module Federation include: Improved support for sharing dynamic and asynchronous modules. Integration with serverless functions and other backend services. Support for sharing modules across multiple programming languages and environments. As Module Federation continues to evolve, we will continue updating documentation, to provide you with the best techniques on how to adopt and integrate with other tools and frameworks.","title":"History of Module Federation","component":"mf-docs","version":"0.2","name":"history","url":"/mf-docs/0.2/history/","titles":[{"text":"Origins of Module Federation","hash":"origins-of-module-federation","id":1},{"text":"Webpack 5 and the Birth of Module Federation","hash":"webpack-5-and-the-birth-of-module-federation","id":2},{"text":"Evolution of Module Federation","hash":"evolution-of-module-federation","id":3},{"text":"Future of Module Federation","hash":"future-of-module-federation","id":4}]},"13":{"id":13,"text":"Rollup.JS, a popular JavaScript module bundler, is known for its efficiency and flexibility. With the advent of Module Federation in Webpack 5, it’s time to bring this powerful feature into the Rollup.JS ecosystem. This guide will walk you through the process of implementing Module Federation in Rollup.JS, allowing you to share code between independently bundled applications seamlessly. The first step in integrating Module Federation with Rollup.JS is to enable your Rollup.JS bundle to act as a Host. This capability allows your bundle to consume modules from Remotes built with Webpack. This feature is facilitated by the @module-federation/rollup-federation plugin, which is available directly from the Module Federation Organization. You can find the plugin on npm and an example of its usage in module-federation-examples repository. Let’s assume we have a Webpack Remote located at http://localhost:8081/remote-entry.js that was built to target SystemJS and exposes a ./hello module that exports a default function. We can consume this remote in a Rollup.JS build with the following setup: In this example, we configure the @module-federation/rollup-federation plugin and alias the remote as webpack_remote. The key is the name we will be importing from in our JavaScript modules, and the value is the name in our SystemJS import map. import federation from '@module-federation/rollup-federation'; export default { input: './src/index.js', output: { format: 'system', dir: './dist' }, plugins: [ federation({ remotes: { 'webpack_remote': 'webpack_remote' }, }) ] }; Next, we dynamically import the remote hello module from the Webpack Remote we have aliased as webpack_remote in the plugin. (async () => { // Import the hello module from the remote const hello = await import('webpack_remote/hello'); // Call the default export of the remote hello module hello.default(); })(); Finally, we configure the SystemJS import map to recognize where webpack_remote is located and start our app by importing the main entry point. { \"webpack_remote\": \"http://localhost:8081/remote-entry.js\", \"main\": \"./dist/main.js\" } Congratulations! You are now consuming Federated Modules in Rollup.JS. For more advanced use-cases, check out the Module Federation Examples repository located at module-federation-examples repository. As of now, a Rollup.JS bundle can only act as a Host, meaning it can consume federated modules and share runtime vendor dependencies with the Remotes it consumes. The potential to act as a Remote, and thereby enable Bidirectional-Hosts, is being considered for future development based on community interest. For any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out on Twitter @ebey_jacob. Contributions to the examples repo for AMD, fixes, or additions to the plugin are always welcome!

The challenge was to share two-digit-number of different vendor modules, but bundle them into one common vendors chunk to reduce the network load of having dozens of different requests simultaneously. The solution was to bundle all different vendor bundles into one using SplitChunksPlugin, resulting in only one request from the host app to the remote app when the vendor library is needed. This guide will demonstrate how to use Webpack’s ModuleFederationPlugin to share modules between two simple web applications, and how to bundle supplementary vendor libraries' bundles into one bundle using Webpack’s SplitChunksPlugin, so that they can be shared between the remote and host applications as one chunk and improve performance. The project consists of the host app (app1), which loads a shared function, a shared component, and a vendors bundle from the remote app (app2). This is a simple demonstration of the work of Webpack’s ModuleFederationPlugin and SplitChunksPlugin. After creating two directories, one for the host and one for the remote app, navigate into the Remote_App directory. Initialize an npm project and install webpack to produce bundles of our code. npm init npm i webpack webpack-cli --save-dev Create the src directory which will hold our shared modules. Create a new file called bootstrap.js and another directory - sharedModules. In the sharedModules directory, create our first shared function - mySharedFunction.js. Leave this file empty for now. Populate bootstrap.js with the following line: import('./sharedModules/mySharedFunction'); For the Module Federation to work, the best way to implement the sharing between code is through dynamic imports like in example above, although sharing through eager consumption of modules is also possible and static imports of shared modules are supported as well. This is because the shared components/vendors are loaded at runtime and it’s best to have them asynchronously imported. Now, navigate back out of the source directory and create a webpack.configuration.js file which is the configuration file for using Webpack with our remote app: const path = require('path'); module.exports = { entry: './src/bootstrap.js', output: { filename: '[name].bundle.js', path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'), clean: true }, mode: 'development' }; The entry point would be our bootstrap.js file. This file would act as an entry point for the dynamic imports of all the shared modules you could have. Every bundle will be outputted to the dist directory. Repeat the same process for the host app. Initialize an npm project and install webpack. npm init npm i webpack webpack-cli --save-dev Create a bootstrap.js file and an empty mainLogic.js file. This file will later on contain dynamic imports of the shared modules. import('./mainLogic'); You can copy-paste the configuration file for Webpack in this host app from the remote app. It contains almost the same configuration, except for the filename prop, it will be only called bundle.js as we will have only that one app-related bundle. filename: 'bundle.js' To host the apps, we use webpack-dev-server, a CLI-based tool for starting a static server for your assets. Besides installing webpack-dev-server, we also need the HtmlWebpackPlugin so we can render HTML files. Therefore, you need to navigate into both host and remote app directories and run the following commands: npm i webpack-dev-server --save-dev npm i html-webpack-plugin --save-dev Next, we need to extend both webpack configuration files, of the host app as well as the remote: devServer: { static: path.join(__dirname,'dist'), port: 3001 }, After including this option in our webpack configuration file of the host, the content from the dist directory will be rendered on port 3001. Let’s create one HTML page now: HOST APP The htmlWebpackPlugin.options.title comes from the title property of the HtmlWebpackPlugin we define in the next step. At the top of the webpack.configuration.js file, we need an import for the plugin: const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin'); We also create a plugins prop in the webpack configuration file containing our HtmlWebpackPlugin setup like the following: plugins: [ new HtmlWebpackPlugin({ title: 'Host app', template: path.resolve(__dirname, './src/template.html') }) ] Now you can add this command to your npm scripts which will start the server. In the package.json, under scripts add \"start\": \"webpack serve --open\". Now if you execute npm start in the terminal, the server should be started at port localhost:3001. Only a white background will be shown with the text \"HOST APP\" written on the screen. The same steps are replicated in the remote app. Firstly, install the required npm packages, then create a template.html and add the npm script for starting the server in the package.json. Update the webpack.configuration.js file of the remote app to look like the following: const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin'); const path = require('path'); module.exports = { entry: './src/bootstrap.js', output: { filename: '[name].bundle.js', path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'), clean: true }, mode: 'development', devServer: { static: path.join(__dirname,'dist'), port: 3000 }, plugins: [ new HtmlWebpackPlugin({ title: 'Remote app', template: path.resolve(__dirname, './src/template.html') }) ] }; Until this point, we only set up the starting code for both apps and hosted them on different ports. Now we need to truly utilize Webpack’s module federation plugin, and the next thing which we would do is share two modules - an ordinary JS function which uses a feature from our first shared vendor library - Lodash and a button styled with the D3 library (D3 is a JS library for manipulating documents based on data, but in our case, for the sake of simplicity we will use it to style the button only). Let’s start with the remote. Firstly, install the Lodash and D3 libraries: npm install lodash d3 The function which will be shared is called myFunction(). It will use the sortedUniq() method from Lodash to remove duplicates from an array of numbers: import _ from 'lodash'; export const myFunction = () => { let sampleArray = [1,1,2,2,2,3,4,5,5,6]; let sortedArray = _.sortedUniq(sampleArray); console.log('My resulting array: ' + sortedArray); } Next, create a button and use D3 to change the internal text color of it: import * as d3 from 'd3'; // create button & fill with text and id param let d3Btn = document.createElement('button'); d3Btn.setAttribute('id','btn-d3'); d3Btn.appendChild(document.createTextNode('D3 Button')); // append to the body let container = document.getElementsByTagName('body'); container[0].appendChild(d3Btn); // use d3 // change color of text to orange d3.select('#btn-d3').style('color','orange'); Next step is to import the modules dynamically, so the bootstrap.js file would look like the following: import('./sharedModules/mySharedFunction'); import('./sharedModules/mySharedButton'); To enable the usage of the ModuleFederationPlugin we need to register it in the configuration file. Import at the top of the file: const { ModuleFederationPlugin } = require('webpack').container; In the plugins section of the configuration we register the plugin: new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: 'remoteApp_oneVendorsBundle', library: { type: 'var', name: 'remoteApp_oneVendorsBundle' }, filename: 'remoteEntry.js', exposes: { './mySharedFunction':'./src/sharedModules/mySharedFunction.js', './mySharedButton':'./src/sharedModules/mySharedButton.js' }, shared: [ 'lodash', 'd3' ] }) We register a name for our application - it would be used by the host app to connect with the remote. We also register a script by the name of remoteEntry.js. This will be the script which enables the sharing of modules between our two apps, and will be automatically generated when building our app. We also need to have a shared section where we put the vendor libraries to be shared with the host app. The only thing we need to do in the host application is to add some code to configure the ModuleFederationPlugin to work with the remote app. First, we require the plugin: const { ModuleFederationPlugin } = require('webpack').container; And in the plugins section we should have the following code: new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: 'hostApp_oneVendorsBundle', library: { type: 'var', name: 'hostApp_oneVendorsBundle' }, remotes: { remoteApp: 'remoteApp_oneVendorsBundle' }, shared: [ 'lodash', 'd3' ] }) Here we need to register the remote app in order to share modules. In our host app we would reference the remote by the name remoteApp. We also need the Lodash and D3 to be shared. The vendor bundles will be loaded together with the bundle for the shared function and button. Proceed to the template.html of the Host_App, and add the following tag in the head of the temlplate.html: The shared myFunction() will be loaded with a click of a button, and we need a which will act as a container for rendering the button, that’s why we need this code in the : Load shared modules By document.getElementById() we get the button from the template.html and we add an onClick event listener which dynamically loads the shared function and button bundle: let loadSharedModulesBtn = document.getElementById('btn-shared-modules-loader'); loadSharedModulesBtn.addEventListener('click', async () => { let sharedFunctionModule = await import('remoteApp/mySharedFunction'); sharedFunctionModule.myFunction(); let sharedButtonModule = await import('remoteApp/mySharedButton'); let sharedButton = document.createElement(sharedButtonModule.name); let sharedButtonContainer = document.getElementById('shared-btn-container'); sharedButtonContainer.appendChild(sharedButton); }) It’s now time to package our code for deployment. To do so, we’ll need to incorporate an npm script in the package.json of both our applications. Please add the following line of code: \"build\": \"webpack --config webpack.config.js\". Once added, you should then run the command npm run build within both applications. Upon execution, the dist directories in each app will showcase the array of bundles generated by Webpack. Upon launching both applications, and pressing the 'Load shared modules' button in the host application, the D3 button will become visible. Additionally, the console log will present the filtered array from the shared function, and the vendor bundles will be accessed from the remote app. Note that it’s essential to initiate the remote app prior to the host, or alternatively, reload the host if you started the applications in a different sequence. If you take a peek at the browser’s developer tools and navigate to the network tab, you’ll observe that the Lodash, D3, and shared module bundles are not loaded until the button is clicked. Post-click, all the bundles are loaded, and we receive a console message from myFunction() from the remote, along with the display of the shared button. Hovering over the bundle names will reveal their origin: they are fetched from the remote, specifically from localhost:3000. Webpack’s SplitChunksPlugin is traditionally employed to accomplish code splitting - the process of segmenting code into smaller, manageable bundles and regulating resource loading. However, in my scenario, I’ve deviated from the standard use and innovatively used this tool to aggregate all vendor code into a singular bundle. In this demonstration, we’re dealing with a limited number of vendor bundles, but this strategy can be immensely advantageous and performance-enhancing when operating at a larger scale with numerous smaller vendor modules. This holds particularly true if the requirement arises to load all vendor bundles simultaneously. We need to add the optimization property to the webpack.configuration.js file of the remote app: optimization: { splitChunks: { cacheGroups: { commons: { test: /[\\\\/]node_modules[\\\\/](lodash|d3|delaunator|internmap|robust-predicates)/, name: 'Vendors_Lodash_D3', chunks: 'all' } } } } You might be curious about 'delaunator' and 'internmap'. These are modules incorporated during the D3 installation. If they’re excluded from the regular expression (regex), they will independently generate separate vendor modules within the 'dist' directory, which diverges from our original intent. This situation can be bypassed by employing a more selective import of D3, avoiding the use of import * as d3 from d3. Upon executing npm run build within the remote application, a unified vendor bundle titled Vendors_Lodash_D3.bundle.js will be produced in the 'dist' directory. To culminate, if you launch both applications, the remote will independently load the entire Vendors_Lodash_D3 bundle and refrain from loading any other vendor modules: Upon selecting the 'load shared modules' button in the host application, it will not only load both the shared function and the shared D3 button bundles, but also exclusively load a single vendor bundle, specifically, the Vendors_Lodash_D3 bundle. In this guide we have shown how to bundle two vendor libraries' bundles into one bundle using Webpack’s SplitChunksPlugin, so that they can be shared between the remote and host applications as one chunk and improve performance. This is a powerful feature of Webpack that can be used to optimize the performance of your applications by reducing the number of requests and the size of the bundles. It also allows for better code organization and separation of concerns by allowing you to share modules between different applications.

We assume you already have a basic understanding of Module Federation and have set it up in your project. If you need a refresher, please refer to the Module Federation setup guide. This guide focuses on the steps required to enable SSR with Module Federation. Table of Contents Understanding the Challenges with SSR and Module Federation Server-Side Bundle Configuration Loading Remote Modules on the Server Rendering Federated Modules on the Server Hydrating the Client-Side Application Conclusion Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique used to improve the initial load time and SEO of web applications by rendering the HTML on the server and sending it to the client. Module Federation, on the other hand, is a feature introduced in Webpack 5 that allows sharing code and dependencies across multiple applications at runtime. While both techniques offer significant benefits, integrating them can be challenging. Module Federation relies on dynamic imports, which are not natively supported during server-side rendering. This guide will demonstrate how to overcome these challenges and set up Module Federation with SSR. To enable SSR with Module Federation, you need to create a separate Webpack configuration for the server-side bundle. This bundle should include the ModuleFederationPlugin with the appropriate settings for server-side rendering. Create a new webpack.server.config.js file with the following configuration: const path = require('path'); const ModuleFederationPlugin = require('webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin'); module.exports = { target: 'node', mode: 'production', entry: './src/server.js', output: { path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'), filename: 'server.js', libraryTarget: 'commonjs2', }, plugins: [ new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: 'serverApp', library: { type: 'commonjs2' }, filename: 'remoteServerEntry.js', exposes: { './serverComponent': './src/serverComponent', }, shared: ['react', 'react-dom'], }), ], }; This configuration specifies the target as node and sets the libraryTarget to commonjs2 since we are targeting a Node.js environment. Make sure to expose the relevant server components in the exposes object. With the server-side bundle configuration in place, the next step is to load the remote modules on the server. We’ll use the require function to import the remote entry file generated by Webpack. In your src/server.js file, add the following code to load the remote entry: const path = require('path'); const { ModuleFederationPlugin } = require('webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin'); const remoteEntryPath = path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist/remoteServerEntry.js'); require(remoteEntryPath); // Your server-side rendering logic goes here Now that we have loaded the remote modules, we need to render them on the server. Since this guide is framework-agnostic, we will provide a general approach that you can adapt to your specific framework. Import the federated module in your server-side rendering code: const serverComponent = require('serverApp/serverComponent'); Render the imported federated module to HTML: This step will depend on your specific framework. Most frameworks provide a method to render components to an HTML string on the server. Use that method to render the imported federated module. Here’s an example of how you might render the federated module using a hypothetical renderToString function: const renderedHTML = renderToString(serverComponent); Send the rendered HTML to the client: Once you have the rendered HTML, send it as part of the response to the client. This step will also depend on your specific framework and server setup. Here’s an example using Express.js: app.get('/', (req, res) => { res.send(` SSR with Module Federation ${renderedHTML} `); }); In this example, we’ve included the remoteEntry.js and client.js files to load the federated modules on the client side. With the server-side rendering complete, the final step is to hydrate the client-side application. Hydration is the process of attaching event listeners and initializing the state of the client-side application based on the server-rendered HTML. Load the remote entry file in your client-side index.html: Import the federated module in your client-side application: import('./bootstrap.js'); Hydrate the client-side application: This step will depend on your specific framework. Most frameworks provide a method to hydrate a client-side application based on the server-rendered HTML. Use that method to hydrate your application with the imported federated module. Here’s an example of how you might hydrate the client-side application using a hypothetical hydrate function: import { hydrate } from 'your-framework'; import ClientComponent from './ClientComponent'; hydrate(, document.getElementById('root')); In this guide, we’ve shown you how to set up Module Federation with Server-Side Rendering in a framework-agnostic manner. By following these steps, you can enjoy the benefits of both Module Federation and SSR, enabling a better user experience, improved initial load times, and enhanced SEO. Remember that the exact implementation will depend on your specific framework and server setup. Always consult the framework’s documentation for detailed guidance and best practices.

Since you are loading modules from different sources, you need to make sure that they don’t conflict with each other or with the host application. Otherwise, you might end up with unexpected behavior, errors, or broken functionality. In this guide, we will show you some best practices for naming your modules and their exports when using Module Federation. We will also explain how Webpack handles naming collisions and how you can customize it to suit your needs. A module is a unit of code that can be loaded by Webpack. It can be a JavaScript file, a CSS file, an image, or any other type of asset. When using Module Federation, you can expose some of your modules to other bundles or applications by using the exposes option in your Webpack configuration. For example, suppose you have a module called utils.js that contains some utility functions. You can expose it to other bundles by adding this to your Webpack configuration: module.exports = { // ... plugins: [ new ModuleFederationPlugin({ // ... exposes: { \"./utils\": \"./src/utils.js\", }, }), ], }; The key of the exposes object is the name of the module that you want to expose. The value is the path to the module file relative to your project root. In this case, we are exposing the module as ./utils and pointing it to ./src/utils.js. When you expose a module, you need to follow some naming conventions to avoid collisions with other modules. Here are some tips: Use a unique prefix for your modules. This can be based on your project name, domain name, or any other identifier that distinguishes your modules from others. For example, if your project is called my-app, you can prefix your modules with my-app/, like this: module.exports = { // ... plugins: [ new ModuleFederationPlugin({ // ... exposes: { \"my-app/utils\": \"./src/utils.js\", }, }), ], }; Avoid using generic or common names for your modules. For example, don’t expose a module as ./react or ./lodash, as these might conflict with other bundles that use the same libraries. Instead, use more specific names that reflect the purpose or content of your modules. For example, if you have a custom React component library, you can expose it as my-app/components, like this: module.exports = { // ... plugins: [ new ModuleFederationPlugin({ // ... exposes: { \"my-app/components\": \"./src/components/index.js\", }, }), ], }; Use consistent naming conventions across your modules. For example, if you use camelCase for your module names, stick to it throughout your project. Don’t mix it with snake_case or kebab-case. This will make your modules easier to find and import. An export is a value or a function that a module provides to other modules. When using Module Federation, you can import exports from other bundles or applications by using the import statement or the import() function. For example, suppose you want to import the utils module that we exposed earlier from another bundle. You can do it like this: import utils from \"my-app/utils\"; Or like this: import(\"my-app/utils\").then((utils) => { // ... }); The name of the export that you import is the same as the name of the module that you expose. In this case, we are importing the default export of the utils module as utils. When you export values or functions from your modules, you need to follow some naming conventions to avoid collisions with other exports. Here are some tips: Use descriptive and meaningful names for your exports. For example, don’t export a function as foo or bar, as these might conflict with other functions that have the same name. Instead, use more specific names that reflect what the function does or returns. For example, if you have a function that calculates the area of a circle, you can export it as calculateCircleArea, like this: export function calculateCircleArea(radius) { return Math.PI * radius * radius; } Use consistent naming conventions across your exports. For example, if you use camelCase for your export names, stick to it throughout your project. Don’t mix it with snake_case or kebab-case. This will make your exports easier to find and import. Avoid using default exports for your modules. Default exports are anonymous and can be imported with any name. This can lead to confusion and inconsistency when importing modules from different sources. For example, if you have a module that exports a React component as the default export, you can import it like this: Approach 1 Approach 2 Approach 3 import MyComponent from \"my-app/components\"; import Foo from \"my-app/components\"; import Bar from \"my-app/components\"; As you can see, the name of the import does not match the name of the module or the component. This can make it hard to track where the component comes from and what it does. Instead, use named exports for your modules and import them with the same name. For example, if you have a module that exports a React component as a named export, you can export and import it like the following: Export Import import MyComponent from \"my-app/components\"; import { MyComponent } from \"my-app/components\"; This way, the name of the import matches the name of the module and the component. This will make your code more readable and maintainable. Sometimes, despite following the naming conventions, you might encounter naming collisions with other modules or exports. This can happen when you import modules from different sources that use the same or similar names for their modules or exports. Webpack provides some options to handle naming collisions and resolve them in a way that suits your needs. Here are some of them: Use aliases to rename modules or exports when importing them. Aliases are alternative names that you can assign to modules or exports when importing them. This can help you avoid conflicts and confusion when dealing with modules or exports that have the same or similar names. For example, suppose you want to import two modules that both expose a utils module. You can use aliases to rename one of them when importing it, like this: Approach 1 Approach 2 import utils from \"my-app/utils\"; // Import utils from my-app import otherUtils as \"other-app/utils\"; // Import utils from other-app and rename it as otherUtils import { utils as myUtils } from \"my-app/utils\"; // Import utils from my-app and rename it as myUtils import { utils as otherUtils } from \"other-app/utils\"; // Import utils from other-app and rename it as otherUtils This way, you can avoid naming collisions and use both modules without confusion. Use scopes to group modules or exports under a common namespace. Scopes are prefixes that you can add to your module or export names to create a hierarchy or a category for them. This can help you organize your modules or exports and avoid conflicts with other sources that use the same or similar names. For example, suppose you want to expose some modules under a scope called my-app. You can add the scope to your module names when exposing them, like this: module.exports = { // ... plugins: [ new ModuleFederationPlugin({ // ... exposes: { \"my-app/utils\": \"./src/utils.js\", \"my-app/components\": \"./src/components/index.js\", }, }), ], }; Then, you can import them with the scope included, like this: import utils from \"my-app/utils\"; // Import utils from my-app scope import components from \"my-app/components\"; // Import components from my-app scope This way, you can avoid naming collisions and use your modules without confusion. Use remotes to specify where to load modules from. Remotes are references to other bundles or applications that expose modules using Module Federation. You can use remotes to specify where to load modules from when importing them. This can help you avoid conflicts and confusion when dealing with modules that have the same or similar names but come from different sources. For example, suppose you want to import a module called utils from another bundle called other-app. You can use remotes to specify where to load the module from, like this: module.exports = { // ... plugins: [ new ModuleFederationPlugin({ // ... remotes: { // Define a remote called other-app that points to the URL of the other bundle other-app: \"other-app@https://other-app.com/remoteEntry.js\", }, }), ], }; Then, you can import the module with the remote name included, like this: import utils from \"other-app/utils\"; // Import utils from other-app remote This way, you can avoid naming collisions and use the module without confusion. Naming your modules and their exports when using Module Federation is an important aspect of creating micro-frontends, sharing code across applications, and optimizing performance and scalability. By following some best practices and conventions, you can avoid naming collisions and ensure that your modules and exports are clear, consistent, and easy to use. You can also leverage Webpack’s options to handle naming collisions and resolve them in a way that suits your needs.","title":"","component":"mf-docs","version":"0.2","name":"naming-convention-tips","url":"/mf-docs/0.2/naming-convention-tips/","titles":[{"text":"Naming conventions for modules and their exports to avoid naming collisions","hash":"naming-conventions-for-modules-and-their-exports-to-avoid-naming-collisions","id":1},{"text":"Naming your modules","hash":"naming-your-modules","id":2},{"text":"Naming your exports","hash":"naming-your-exports","id":3},{"text":"Handling naming collisions","hash":"handling-naming-collisions","id":4},{"text":"Conclusion","hash":"conclusion","id":5}]},"17":{"id":17,"text":"Module Federation is a relatively new feature in web development that allows developers to share entire modules between multiple applications. While it has the potential to significantly improve code sharing and reduce duplication, there are also potential drawbacks and limitations to using Module Federation. In this guide, we’ll explore the pros and cons of Module Federation, including its benefits and limitations. One of the primary benefits of Module Federation is that it can significantly reduce code duplication between applications. Instead of duplicating code across multiple applications, developers can share modules between them, reducing the size and complexity of each application. Module Federation can also improve collaboration between development teams. By allowing multiple applications to share the same codebase, developers can work more closely together, sharing knowledge and expertise and working more efficiently. Module Federation also provides greater flexibility and modularity in application design. By breaking applications down into smaller, more manageable modules, developers can more easily swap out and replace modules as needed, without having to rewrite entire applications. In some cases, Module Federation can also improve application performance. By reducing the amount of code that needs to be loaded and executed by each application, Module Federation can help to reduce load times and improve overall performance. Module Federation can also improve scalability by allowing developers to distribute functionality across multiple applications. This approach can help to reduce the size and complexity of individual applications, making them easier to maintain and scale. One of the primary drawbacks of Module Federation is that it can increase the complexity of application development. Sharing modules between applications requires careful management of dependencies and versioning, which can be challenging to implement and maintain. Module Federation also introduces potential security risks. Sharing code between applications can create vulnerabilities, particularly if proper security measures are not in place. Module Federation can also increase coupling between applications, making it more difficult to make changes to individual applications without affecting others. This can lead to a loss of flexibility and modularity in application design. In some cases, Module Federation can also introduce potential performance issues. Remote loading of modules can introduce additional latency and increase load times, particularly if modules are large or complex. Module Federation is a powerful feature that offers many benefits for web developers, including increased code reusability, improved scalability, reduced development time, and improved performance. However, there are also potential drawbacks to consider, including increased complexity, potential security risks and possible performance overhead. Advanced users should carefully weigh the pros and cons of Module Federation when deciding whether to use this feature in their applications. They should also take appropriate measures to mitigate any risks and ensure that their applications are secure, performant, and maintainable.","title":"Pros and Cons of Module Federation: A Comprehensive Overview","component":"mf-docs","version":"0.2","name":"pros-cons","url":"/mf-docs/0.2/pros-cons/","titles":[{"text":"Pros of Module Federation","hash":"pros-of-module-federation","id":1},{"text":"Reduced Code Duplication","hash":"reduced-code-duplication","id":2},{"text":"Improved Collaboration","hash":"improved-collaboration","id":3},{"text":"Greater Flexibility","hash":"greater-flexibility","id":4},{"text":"Improved Performance","hash":"improved-performance","id":5},{"text":"Improved Scalability","hash":"improved-scalability","id":6},{"text":"Cons of Module Federation","hash":"cons-of-module-federation","id":7},{"text":"Increased Complexity","hash":"increased-complexity","id":8},{"text":"Security Risks","hash":"security-risks","id":9},{"text":"Increased Coupling","hash":"increased-coupling","id":10},{"text":"Potential Performance Issues","hash":"potential-performance-issues","id":11},{"text":"Conclusion","hash":"conclusion","id":12}]},"18":{"id":18,"text":"In this guide, we’ll cover how to set the public path dynamically for Module Federation. This is particularly useful when deploying federated modules to different environments with varying public paths. One of the challenges of using Module Federation is to configure the public path of each Webpack build correctly, so that it can load remote modules from other builds at runtime. The public path is the base URL for all assets (including JavaScript files) in a Webpack build. By default, Webpack sets the public path to the current HTML document’s base URL or location. However, this may not work well for Module Federation scenarios, where the public path needs to point to the location of the remote container that exposes the modules. There are three ways to set the public path dynamically for Module Federation: using an inline script tag, using a custom entry point, or using startup code. One way to set the public path dynamically is to use an inline script tag in the HTML document that hosts the Webpack build. The script tag should assign the webpack_public_path variable to the desired public path before loading the main JavaScript file. For example: // Set the public path to the location of the remote container __webpack_public_path__ = \"https://example.com/remote/\"; This approach has the advantage of being simple and straightforward, but it has some drawbacks: It requires modifying the HTML document for each webpack build, which may not be feasible or desirable in some cases. It may not work well with code splitting or lazy loading, as the public path needs to be set before any JavaScript file is loaded. It may cause issues with caching or content delivery networks (CDNs), as the public path is hard-coded in the HTML document and cannot be changed dynamically. Another way to set the public path dynamically is to use a custom entry point in the webpack configuration. The custom entry point should import a module that sets the webpack_public_path variable to the desired public path based on some logic or environment variables. For example: entry.js set-public-path.js webpack.config.js // entry.js // Import a module that sets the public path import \"./set-public-path.js\"; // Import other modules as usual import \"./app.js\"; // set-public-path.js // Set the public path based on some logic or environment variables __webpack_public_path__ = process.env.PUBLIC_PATH || \"https://example.com/remote/\"; // webpack.config.js module.exports = { // Use the custom entry point entry: \"./entry.js\", // Other configuration options... }; This approach has the advantage of being more flexible and robust, as it allows setting the public path based on any logic or environment variables. It also works well with code splitting or lazy loading, as the public path is set before any remote module is loaded. However, it has some drawbacks: It requires creating a custom entry point and a module that sets the public path, which may add some complexity and overhead to the webpack configuration. It may not work well with hot module replacement (HMR), as changing the public path may require reloading the entire application. Startup code is an implementation tactic to attach additional runtime code to a remote container startup sequence. This is useful for scenarios where the public path needs to be set based on some logic or environment variables that are not available at build time. To use startup code, we need to do the following steps: Create an entry point with the same name as the name we place in ModuleFederationPlugin. This merges the two \"chunks\" together. When a remoteEntry is placed on the page, the code in this entry point will execute as part of the remoteEntry startup. In the entry point, import a module that sets the webpack_public_path variable to the desired public path based on some logic or environment variables. Exclude the entry point chunk from the HTML document, as it will be loaded by the remoteEntry. For example, let’s say we have a remote container named \"app1\" that exposes some modules. We want to set its public path based on an environment variable called PUBLIC_PATH. Here is how we can use startup code to achieve this: entry.js set-public-path.js webpack.config.js // entry.js // Import a module that sets the public path import \"./set-public-path.js\"; // Import other modules as usual import \"./app.js\"; // set-public-path.js // Set the public path based on an environment variable __webpack_public_path__ = process.env.PUBLIC_PATH || \"https://example.com/remote/\"; // webpack.config.js module.exports = { // Use the custom entry point entry: { // we add an entrypoint with the same name as our name in ModuleFederationPlugin. // This merges the two \"chunks\" together. When a remoteEntry is placed on the page, // the code in this app1 entrypoint will execute as part of the remoteEntry startup. app1: \"./src/set-public-path.js\", main: \"./src/index.js\", }, mode: \"development\", output: { // public path can be what it normally is, not a absolute, hardcoded url publicPath: \"/\", }, plugins: [ new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: \"app1\", remotes: { app2: \"app2@http://localhost:3002/remoteEntry.js\", }, shared: { react: { singleton: true, }, \"react-dom\": { singleton: true, }, }, }), new HtmlWebpackPlugin({ template: \"./public/index.html\", // exclude app1 chunk, just incase HTML webpack plugin tries to do something silly. // It doesn't have the best MF support right now when it comes to advanced implementations excludeChunks: [\"app1\"], }), ], }; This way, we can set the public path of app1 dynamically at runtime based on the PUBLIC_PATH environment variable. If it is not defined, we fall back to a default value of \"https://example.com/remote/\". Basic host remote example, with startup code that sets the remotes public path dynamically.

There are three ways to do this: using an inline script tag, using a custom entry point, or using startup code.

Using an inline script tag is simple and straightforward, but it may not work well with code splitting or lazy loading, and it may cause issues with caching or CDNs. Using a custom entry point is more flexible and robust, but it may add some complexity and overhead to the webpack configuration, and it may not work well with HMR. Using startup code is a powerful and advanced technique that allows injecting custom code into the webpack runtime, but it may require some familiarity with webpack internals and Module Federation.","title":"Setting the Dynamic Public Path","component":"mf-docs","version":"0.2","name":"public-path-dynamic","url":"/mf-docs/0.2/public-path-dynamic/","titles":[{"text":"Using an inline script tag","hash":"using-an-inline-script-tag","id":1},{"text":"Using a custom entry point","hash":"using-a-custom-entry-point","id":2},{"text":"Using startup code","hash":"using-startup-code","id":3},{"text":"Additional Reading","hash":"additional-reading","id":4},{"text":"Conclusion","hash":"conclusion","id":5}]},"19":{"id":19,"text":"Module Federation is a feature of Webpack that allows you to dynamically load modules from different bundles at runtime. This can help you improve the resiliency and failover capabilities of your web applications by reducing the impact of network failures, server errors, or code bugs. Resiliency is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. Failovers are the mechanisms that allow a system to switch to a backup or alternative mode of operation when a failure occurs. In this guide, you will learn how to use Module Federation to: Load modules from remote sources with fallbacks Handle errors and retries when loading modules Implement a circuit breaker pattern to avoid cascading failures Use service workers to cache modules and serve them offline To follow this guide, you need to have: A basic understanding of Webpack and Module Federation Node.js and npm installed on your machine A code editor of your choice To demonstrate how Module Federation works, we will create a simple web application that consists of two parts: a host app and a remote app. The host app will load a module from the remote app and display its content on the page. The remote app will expose a module that returns a greeting message. To set up the project, follow these steps: Create a new folder called module-federation-demo and navigate to it in your terminal. Run npm init -y to create a package.json file with default values. Run npm install webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin to install the dependencies. Create two subfolders called host and remote inside the module-federation-demo folder. These will contain the source code for the host app and the remote app respectively. Create a webpack.config.js file in each subfolder with the following content: host webpack.config remote webpack.config // webpack.config.js for host app const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require(\"html-webpack-plugin\"); const { ModuleFederationPlugin } = require(\"webpack\").container; module.exports = { mode: \"development\", devServer: { port: 3000, }, plugins: [ new HtmlWebpackPlugin({ template: \"./src/index.html\", }), new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: \"host\", remotes: { remote: \"remote@http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js\", }, }), ], }; // webpack.config.js for remote app const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require(\"html-webpack-plugin\"); const { ModuleFederationPlugin } = require(\"webpack\").container; module.exports = { mode: \"development\", devServer: { port: 3001, }, plugins: [ new HtmlWebpackPlugin({ template: \"./src/index.html\", }), new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: \"remote\", filename: \"remoteEntry.js\", exposes: { \"./greeting\": \"./src/greeting.js\", }, }), ], }; The ModuleFederationPlugin is the main plugin that enables Module Federation. It takes some options that define how the modules are exposed and consumed. In the host app, we specify a remotes option that tells Webpack where to find the remote app’s entry point. The syntax is @, where is an alias that we can use to import modules from the remote app, and is the URL of the remote app’s entry point. In the remote app, we specify a filename option that tells Webpack what name to use for the entry point file. We also specify an exposes option that tells Webpack what modules we want to expose to other apps. The syntax is :, where is an alias that other apps can use to import our module, and is the relative path to our module file. Create an index.html file in each subfolder with the following content: host index.html remote index.html Host App Host App Remote App Remote App The index.html files are the entry points for the web applications. They load the respective JavaScript bundles generated by Webpack. Create a src folder in each subfolder and add the following files: Host: index.js // src/index.js for host app import(\"./bootstrap\"); bootstrap.js // src/bootstrap.js for host app import React from \"react\"; import ReactDOM from \"react-dom\"; import App from \"./App\"; ReactDOM.render(, document.getElementById(\"container\")); App.js // src/App.js for host app import React, { useEffect, useState } from \"react\"; const App = () => { const [greeting, setGreeting] = useState(\"\"); useEffect(() => { // Load the greeting module from the remote app import(\"remote/greeting\") .then((module) => { // Call the module's default export function and set the greeting state setGreeting(module.default()); }) .catch((error) => { // Handle any errors while loading the module console.error(error); setGreeting(\"Oops, something went wrong!\"); }); }, []); return ( The greeting from the remote app is: {greeting} ); }; export default App; Remote index.js // src/index.js for remote app import(\"./bootstrap\"); bootstrap.js // src/bootstrap.js for remote app import React from \"react\"; import ReactDOM from \"react-dom\"; import Greeting from \"./Greeting\"; ReactDOM.render(, document.getElementById(\"root\")); greeting.js // src/Greeting.js for remote app import React from \"react\"; const Greeting = () => { return Hello from the remote app!; }; export default Greeting; The src/index.js files are the entry points for the JavaScript bundles. They import a bootstrap.js file that contains the actual logic of the apps. This is a common pattern to enable asynchronous loading of modules with Module Federation. The src/bootstrap.js files for the host app and the remote app use React to render some components on the page. The host app imports a App.js file that contains a component that loads the greeting module from the remote app and displays it on the page. The remote app imports a Greeting.js file that contains a component that renders a greeting message on the page. The src/greeting.js file for the remote app is the module that we expose to other apps. It exports a function that returns a greeting message. Run npm run dev in both subfolders to start the development servers. You should see something like this in your browser: You have successfully set up a basic Module Federation project. Next, we will see how to improve its resiliency and failover capabilities. == Loading modules with fallbacks One of the benefits of Module Federation is that it allows you to load modules from remote sources without having to bundle them with your application. This can reduce your bundle size and improve your performance. However, this also introduces some risks. What if the remote source is unavailable or slow? What if the module fails to load or execute? How can you ensure that your application still works in these scenarios? One way to handle these situations is to provide fallbacks for your modules. A fallback is an alternative module that you can load in case the original module fails. For example, you can provide a local copy of the module, or a mock module that returns some dummy data. To use fallbacks with Module Federation, you can use the fallback option of the ModuleFederationPlugin. This option allows you to specify an object that maps remote names to fallback modules. For example, you can modify your host app’s Webpack configuration like this: // webpack.config.js for host app const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require(\"html-webpack-plugin\"); const { ModuleFederationPlugin } = require(\"webpack\").container; module.exports = { mode: \"development\", devServer: { port: 3000, }, plugins: [ new HtmlWebpackPlugin({ template: \"./src/index.html\", }), new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: \"host remotes: { remote: \"remote@http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js\", }, // Specify the fallback modules for the remote app fallback: { remote: \"./src/fallback.js\", }, }), ], }; The fallback option tells Webpack to load the src/fallback.js file as a fallback for the remote app. This file should export the same modules as the remote app, but with different implementations. For example, you can create a src/fallback.js file like this: // src/fallback.js for host app // Export a mock greeting module that returns a static message export const greeting = () => { return \"Hello from the fallback module!\"; }; Now, if the remote app fails to load or expose the greeting module, the host app will use the fallback module instead. You can test this by stopping the remote app’s server and refreshing the host app’s page. You should see something like this: You have successfully implemented a fallback mechanism for your modules. Next, we will see how to handle errors and retries when loading modules. ## Handling errors and retries when loading modules Another way to improve the resiliency of your web application is to handle errors and retries when loading modules from remote sources. This can help you recover from temporary failures or network issues. To handle errors and retries with Module Federation, you can use the import() function that Webpack provides. This function returns a promise that resolves to the module object if the module is loaded successfully, or rejects with an error if the module fails to load. You can use the catch() method of the promise to handle any errors and retry loading the module if needed. For example, you can modify your host app’s App.js file like this: // src/App.js for host app import React, { useEffect, useState } from \"react\"; const App = () => { const [greeting, setGreeting] = useState(\"\"); const [retryCount, setRetryCount] = useState(0); useEffect(() => { // Load the greeting module from the remote app import(\"remote/greeting\") .then((module) => { // Call the module's default export function and set the greeting state setGreeting(module.default()); }) .catch((error) => { // Handle any errors while loading the module console.error(error); // Check if we have reached the maximum number of retries if (retryCount { import(\"remote/greeting\").then((module) => { setGreeting(module.default()); }); }, 1000); } else { // Give up and show an error message setGreeting(\"Sorry, we could not load the greeting module.\"); } }); }, [retryCount]); return ( The greeting from the remote app is: {greeting} ); }; export default App; The App.js file now uses a retryCount state to keep track of how many times it has tried to load the greeting module. If the module fails to load, it checks if the retry count is less than 3. If so, it increments the retry count and tries to load the module again after 1 second. If not, it gives up and shows an error message. You can test this by simulating a network failure in your browser’s developer tools. You should see something like this: You have successfully implemented an error handling and retry mechanism for your modules. Next, we will see how to implement a circuit breaker pattern to avoid cascading failures. ## Implementing a circuit breaker pattern to avoid cascading failures Another way to improve the resiliency of your web application is to implement a circuit breaker pattern to avoid cascading failures. A circuit breaker is a design pattern that monitors the health of a remote service and prevents excessive requests when the service is unhealthy. This can help you avoid overloading the service or wasting resources when the service is unlikely to respond. To implement a circuit breaker pattern with Module Federation, you can use a third-party library called opossum. This library provides a circuitBreaker function that wraps a promise-based function and monitors its success and failure rates. It also provides some options to configure the circuit breaker’s behavior, such as the failure threshold, the timeout duration, and the reset timeout. For example, you can modify your host app’s App.js file like this: // src/App.js for host app import React, { useEffect, useState } from \"react\"; import { circuitBreaker } from \"opossum\"; const App = () => { const [greeting, setGreeting] = useState(\"\"); useEffect(() => { // Create a circuit breaker for loading the greeting module const breaker = circuitBreaker(() => import(\"remote/greeting\"), { // Set the failure threshold to 50% errorThresholdPercentage: 50, // Set the timeout duration to 3 seconds timeout: 3000, // Set the reset timeout to 10 seconds resetTimeout: 10000, }); // Load the greeting module using the circuit breaker breaker .fire() .then((module) => { // Call the module's default export function and set the greeting state setGreeting(module.default()); }) .catch((error) => { // Handle any errors while loading the module console.error(error); // Check if the circuit breaker is open if (breaker.opened) { // Show a message that the service is unavailable setGreeting(\"The remote service is unavailable. Please try again later.\"); } else { // Show a message that something went wrong setGreeting(\"Oops, something went wrong!\"); } }); }, []); return ( The greeting from the remote app is: {greeting} ); }; export default App; The App.js file now uses a circuit breaker to load the greeting module. The circuit breaker will monitor the success and failure rates of loading the module and open or close accordingly. If the circuit breaker is open, it will reject any requests immediately and show a message that the service is unavailable. If the circuit breaker is closed, it will try to load the module normally and show a message that something went wrong if it fails. You can test this by simulating a network failure in your browser’s developer tools. You should see something like this: You have successfully implemented a circuit breaker pattern for your modules. Next, we will see how to use service workers to cache modules and serve them offline. ## Using service workers to cache modules and serve them offline Another way to improve the resiliency of your web application is to use service workers to cache modules and serve them offline. A service worker is a script that runs in the background and intercepts network requests. It can cache the responses and serve them from the cache when the network is unavailable or slow. This can help you improve the performance and reliability of your web application. To use service workers with Module Federation, you can use a third-party library called workbox. This library provides some tools and modules to simplify the creation and management of service workers. It also provides some strategies to control how the service worker handles network requests and cache responses. For example, you can modify your host app’s Webpack configuration like this: // webpack.config.js for host app const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require(\"html-webpack-plugin\"); const { ModuleFederationPlugin } = require(\"webpack\").container; const { InjectManifest } = require(\"workbox-webpack-plugin\"); module.exports = { mode: \"development\", devServer: { port: 3000, }, plugins: [ new HtmlWebpackPlugin({ template: \"./src/index.html\", }), new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: \"host\", remotes: { remote: \"remote@http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js\", }, fallback: { remote: \"./src/fallback.js\", }, }), // Use the InjectManifest plugin to generate a service worker new InjectManifest({ swSrc: \"./src/sw.js\", swDest: \"sw.js\", }), ], }; The InjectManifest plugin is a plugin that generates a service worker based on a source file. It takes some options that define the source and destination of the service worker file. In this case, we specify a swSrc option that tells Webpack to use the src/sw.js file as the source of the service worker. We also specify a swDest option that tells Webpack what name to use for the generated service worker file. Next, we need to create a src/sw.js file that contains the logic of the service worker. We can use the workbox modules to implement some caching strategies for our modules. For example, we can create a src/sw.js file like this: // src/sw.js for host app import { precacheAndRoute } from \"workbox-precaching\"; import { registerRoute } from \"workbox-routing\"; import { StaleWhileRevalidate } from \"workbox-strategies\"; // Precache and route the files generated by Webpack precacheAndRoute(self.__WB_MANIFEST); // Register a route for remote modules using a stale-while-revalidate strategy registerRoute( ({ url }) => url.origin === \"http://localhost:3001\", new StaleWhileRevalidate() ); The sw.js file imports some modules from workbox and uses them to implement some caching strategies for our modules. The precacheAndRoute function takes an array of files to precache and route. In this case, we pass it the self.__WB_MANIFEST variable, which is an array of files generated by Webpack. This will ensure that our host app’s files are cached and served from the cache when offline. The registerRoute function takes a matching function and a caching strategy. In this case, we pass it a function that matches any requests to the remote app’s origin, and a StaleWhileRevalidate strategy. This will ensure that any remote modules are cached and served from the cache if available, while also updating the cache in the background if possible. Finally, we need to register the service worker in our host app’s index.html file. We can add a script tag like this: Host App Host App if (\"serviceWorker\" in navigator) { window.addEventListener(\"load\", () => { navigator.serviceWorker.register(\"/sw.js\"); }); } The script tag checks if the browser supports service workers and registers the sw.js file as a service worker. Now, if you reload your host app’s page, you should see something like this in your browser’s developer tools: You have successfully registered a service worker that caches your modules and serves them offline. You can test this by simulating an offline mode in your browser’s developer tools. You should see something like this: You have successfully implemented a service worker to cache modules and serve them offline. ## Conclusion In this guide, you learned how to use Module Federation to improve the resiliency and failover capabilities of your web applications.

Use the shared modules in your applications as needed. For more information and advanced configuration options, please refer to the official Webpack documentation.","title":"Setting up Module Federation","component":"mf-docs","version":"0.2","name":"setup","url":"/mf-docs/0.2/setup/","titles":[{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"prerequisites","id":1},{"text":"Installation Instructions","hash":"installation-instructions","id":2},{"text":"Configuration Options","hash":"configuration-options","id":3},{"text":"Using Module Federation","hash":"using-module-federation","id":4}]},"21":{"id":21,"text":"This documentation page provides an in-depth explanation of the Module Federation Shared API, its configuration options, use cases, and benefits as well as potential downsides. This guide is intended for users looking to optimize the performance of their distributed applications. The Shared API is a part of the Module Federation plugin configuration options. It allows you to pass an array or object called shared containing a list of dependencies that can be shared and used by other federated apps (aka \"remotes\"). Here’s an example of how to use the Shared API in Module Federation: new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: \"host\", filename: \"remoteEntry.js\", remotes: {}, exposes: {}, shared: [], }); shared (object | [string]): An object or Array of strings containing a list of dependencies that can be shared and consumed by other federated apps. eager (boolean): If true, the dependency will be eagerly loaded and made available to other federated apps as soon as the host application starts. If false, the dependency will be lazily loaded when it is first requested by a federated app. singleton (boolean): If true, the dependency will be treated as a singleton, and only a single instance of it will be shared among all federated apps. requiredVersion (string): Specifies the required version of the dependency. If a federated app tries to load an incompatible version of the dependency, two copies will be loaded. If the singleton option is set to true, a warning will be printed in the console. When using federated modules, they are bundled separately and include all the dependencies they need to function. However, when they’re used in a host application, it’s possible for multiple copies of the same dependency to be downloaded. This can hurt performance and make users download more JavaScript than necessary. The Shared API helps prevent this issue by enabling you to avoid downloading multiple copies of the same dependency, ultimately improving the performance of your application. Consider the following example: you have two modules, Module A and Module B, both of which require lodash to function independently. When these modules are used in a host application that brings both modules together, the Shared API comes into play. If a preloaded, shared copy of lodash is available, Module A and Module B will use that copy instead of loading their own independent copies. This copy could be loaded by the host or another remote application inside it. Both the remote and host have to add the same dependency in \"shared\" for it to be available for consumption. new ModuleFederationPlugin({ ... shared: [\"lodash\"], }); If you are familiar with Dynamic Imports, Module Federation operates similarly; it requests a module and returns a promise that resolves with an object containing all exports from the moduleName declared in the exposes object. The asynchronous nature of Module Federation makes the Shared API highly flexible. When a module is required, it will load a file called remoteEntry.js, listing all the dependencies the module needs. Since this operation is asynchronous, the container can check all the remoteEntry files and list all the dependencies that each module has declared in shared. Then, the host can load a single copy and share it with all the modules that need it. Because shared relies on an asynchronous operation to inspect and resolve the dependencies, if your application or module loads synchronously and declares a dependency in shared, you might encounter the following error: Uncaught Error: Shared module is not available for eager consumption To solve the error above, there are two options: new ModuleFederationPlugin({ ... shared: { lodash: { eager: true, }, }, }); Individual dependencies can be marked as eager: true. This option doesn’t put the dependencies in an async chunk, so they can be provided synchronously. However, this means that those dependencies will always be downloaded, potentially impacting bundle size. The recommended solution is to load your module asynchronously by wrapping it into an async boundary: This only applies to the application’s entry point; remote modules consumed via module federation are automatically wrapped in an Async Boundary. To create an async boundary, use a dynamic import to ensure your entry point runs asynchronously: index.js bootstrap.js import('./bootstrap.js'); import React from 'react'; import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'; import App from './App'; ReactDOM.render(, document.getElementById('root')); What happens if two remote modules use different versions of the same dependency? Module Federation is capable of handling this situation by default. If the semantic version ranges for those dependencies don’t match, Module Federation can identify them and provide separate copies. This ensures that you don’t accidentally load the wrong version containing breaking changes. While this can cause performance issues due to downloading different versions of a dependency, it prevents your app from breaking. To guarantee that only one copy of a given dependency is loaded at all times (e.g., React), pass singleton: true to the dependency object: shared: { react: { singleton: true, requiredVersion: \"^18.0.0\", }, \"react-dom\": { singleton: true, requiredVersion: \"^18.0.0\" }, }, If one of your remote modules tries to load an incompatible dependency version that has been marked as a singleton, Webpack will print a warning in the console. The build will not break, and Webpack will continue to bundle and load your applications. However, the warning serves as a reminder to align your dependencies to avoid potential issues. While the Shared API is a powerful tool, it’s important to be aware of some potential issues and trade-offs associated with its use. Here are some issues that you might encounter using the Shared API: As applications are compiled at different times by distinct Webpack processes, they lack a common dependency graph. As a result, you must depend on Semantic Versioning ranges for deduplication and providing identical dependency versions. There might be a situation where your remote has been built and tested with version 1.0.0 of a library. However, when the host loads it, the Semantic Versioning Range ^1.0.0 satisfies 1.1.0, causing the 1.1.0 version to load at runtime in production. This could lead to compatibility issues. One way to mitigate this risk is by aligning versions to the greatest extent possible (using a monorepo with a single package JSON could be beneficial). This challenge pertains to our reliance on Semantic Versioning ranges, rather than the Module Federation and Shared API themselves. In distributed systems (akin to microservices), a contract is necessary to ensure system stability and dependability. In the context of the Shared API, the Semantic Version Range serves as the contract (though it may not be the most reliable one). From our experience, there is no superior alternative for shared dependencies in a distributed frontend application. Despite the Shared API’s imperfections, it remains the most effective option currently available. In summary, the Module Federation Shared API is a potent instrument for enhancing the performance of distributed applications. It enables dependency sharing across modules, preventing redundant duplication and leading to quicker load times and superior overall performance. Nevertheless, it’s crucial to be cognizant of potential issues and compromises, such as inconsistencies in dependencies at runtime. By recognizing these potential challenges and actively working to address them, you can effectively employ the Shared API to optimize your distributed applications. To make the most of the Shared API, ensure that your team understands its features, limitations, and best practices. Regularly review and update dependencies, align versions, and monitor for potential compatibility issues. By staying proactive in managing these aspects, you can continue to improve the performance and reliability of your distributed applications while minimizing risks associated with dependency management. In conclusion, while the Module Federation Shared API isn’t without its drawbacks, it remains a powerful and valuable tool for developers working with distributed applications. By being aware of its limitations and working diligently to mitigate potential issues, you can harness the full potential of the Shared API to create efficient, high-performance distributed systems.","title":"Module Federation Shared API","component":"mf-docs","version":"0.2","name":"shared-api","url":"/mf-docs/0.2/shared-api/","titles":[{"text":"Overview of the Shared API","hash":"overview-of-the-shared-api","id":1},{"text":"API Definition","hash":"api-definition","id":2},{"text":"Benefits of Using the Shared API","hash":"benefits-of-using-the-shared-api","id":3},{"text":"Avoiding Duplication","hash":"avoiding-duplication","id":4},{"text":"How the Shared API Works","hash":"how-the-shared-api-works","id":5},{"text":"Async Dependency Loading","hash":"async-dependency-loading","id":6},{"text":"Eager Consumption","hash":"eager-consumption","id":7},{"text":"Using an Async Boundary","hash":"using-an-async-boundary","id":8},{"text":"Versioning","hash":"versioning","id":9},{"text":"Singleton Loading","hash":"singleton-loading","id":10},{"text":"Drawbacks and Compromises","hash":"drawbacks-and-compromises","id":11},{"text":"Inconsistencies in Dependencies at Runtime","hash":"inconsistencies-in-dependencies-at-runtime","id":12},{"text":"Conclusion","hash":"conclusion","id":13}]},"22":{"id":22,"text":"In this guide, you will learn how to create a shared header and footer component using Module Federation, and how to use them in two different applications. You will also learn how to handle routing, authentication, and styling in the shared components. The first step is to create a separate project that will contain the header and footer components. This project will act as a host for the shared components, and will expose them using Module Federation. Create a new folder called shared-components and navigate to it. Run npm init -y to initialize a new Node.js project. Run npm install webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin @webpack-cli/serve to install the necessary dependencies. Create a new file called webpack.config.js in the root folder and add the following code: const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require(\"html-webpack-plugin\"); module.exports = { mode: \"development\", devServer: { port: 3000, }, plugins: [ new HtmlWebpackPlugin({ template: \"./public/index.html\", }), ], }; This is a basic Webpack configuration that will serve an HTML file using the webpack-dev-server. Create a new folder called public and add a new file called index.html with the following content: Shared Components This is the HTML file that will be served by the webpack-dev-server. It has two empty divs with ids header and footer, where we will render our shared components. Run npm install react react-dom to install React as a dependency. Create a new folder called src and add two files: Header.js and Footer.js. These files will contain the React components for the header and footer. In Header.js, add the following code: import React from \"react\"; function Header() { return ( Shared Header Home About Contact ); } export default Header; This is a simple header component that has a title and a navigation menu. In Footer.js, add the following code: import React from \"react\"; function Footer() { return ( © 2023 Shared Components.

We also specify the name and filename of the remote entry point and the shared dependencies that we want to avoid duplication. Run npm install babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-react to install the necessary dependencies for transpiling JSX code.

The next step is to create two different applications that will consume the shared header and footer components. These applications will act as remotes for the shared components, and will import them using Module Federation. Create a new folder called app1 and navigate to it. Run npm init -y to initialize a new Node.js project. Run npm install webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin @webpack-cli/serve react react-dom to install the necessary dependencies.

We also specify the name and filename of the remote entry point and the shared dependencies that we want to avoid duplication. Create a new folder called public and add a new file called index.html with the following content: App 1 This is the HTML file that will be served by the webpack-dev-server.

They enable you to share code across different applications without requiring a build step or a centralized package registry. Federated Modules allow you to create a more modular and decoupled architecture for your web applications. However, working with Federated Modules also introduces some challenges for team collaboration and code review. How do you ensure that your code is consistent, readable, and secure across different modules and applications? How do you manage dependencies and avoid breaking changes? How do you test and debug your code in a federated environment? In this guide, we will explore some best practices and tools for team collaboration and code review when working with Federated Modules. We will cover the following topics: Code formatting and linting Code documentation and comments Code quality and security Dependency management and versioning Testing and debugging Code formatting and linting are essential for maintaining a consistent and readable code style across your team. They help you avoid common errors, enforce best practices, and improve the readability of your code. They also make it easier to review your code changes and spot potential issues. There are many tools available for code formatting and linting, such as Prettier, ESLint, Stylelint, etc. You can use them to automatically format and lint your code according to a set of rules that you define or adopt from a popular style guide. You can also integrate them with your editor, IDE, or build tool to format and lint your code on save, on commit, or on build. When working with Federated Modules, you should use the same code formatting and linting tools and rules across all your modules and applications. This will ensure that your code is consistent and compatible across different federated environments. You should also configure your tools to support the syntax and features of Federated Modules, such as dynamic imports, module federation plugins, etc. For example, if you are using Prettier for code formatting, you can add the following options to your .prettierrc file to support dynamic imports: { \"parser\": \"babel\", \"plugins\": [\"@babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import\"] } If you are using ESLint for code linting, you can add the following options to your .eslintrc file to support module federation plugins: { \"parserOptions\": { \"sourceType\": \"module\", \"ecmaVersion\": 2020 }, \"plugins\": [\"@module-federation/eslint-plugin\"] } Code documentation and comments are important for explaining the purpose, functionality, and usage of your code. They help you communicate your design decisions, assumptions, and limitations to other developers who work with or consume your code. They also make it easier to maintain, update, and reuse your code in the future. There are many tools available for code documentation and comments, such as JSDoc, TypeScript Markdown, etc. You can use them to write structured and descriptive comments in your code that document the parameters, return values, types, examples, etc. of your functions, classes, variables, etc. You can also use them to generate HTML pages or PDF files that contain the documentation of your code. When working with Federated Modules, you should use the same code documentation and comments tools and conventions across all your modules and applications. This will ensure that your code is well-documented and understandable across different federated environments. You should also document the specific aspects of Federated Modules in your code comments, such as the exposed modules, the remote modules, the shared modules, etc. For example, if you are using JSDoc for code documentation, you can add the following tags to your comments to document the exposed modules: /** * A module that exposes a greeting function. * @module greeting * @expose greeting */ /** * A function that returns a greeting message. * @param {string} name - The name of the person to greet. * @returns {string} A greeting message. */ export function greeting(name) { return `Hello ${name}!`; } If you are using TypeScript for code documentation, you can add the following types to your comments to document the remote modules: /** * A type that represents a remote module that provides a math utility. * @remote math */ type MathModule = { /** * A function that adds two numbers * @param {number} x - The first number. * @param {number} y - The second number. * @returns {number} The sum of x and y. */ add: (x: number, y: number) => number; }; /** * A function that imports and uses a remote module. * @async * @returns {Promise} */ async function useRemoteModule() { // Import the remote module using dynamic import const math = await import(\"math@http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js\"); // Use the remote module as a normal module const result = math.add(1, 2); console.log(result); // 3 } Code quality and security are essential for ensuring that your code is reliable, maintainable, and safe. They help you avoid bugs, errors, vulnerabilities, and performance issues that can affect the functionality and usability of your code. They also make it easier to review your code changes and ensure that they meet the quality and security standards of your team. There are many tools available for code quality and security, such as Jest, Mocha, Chai, Sinon, Cypress, Codecov, SonarQube, Snyk, etc. You can use them to write unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, code coverage reports, code analysis reports, vulnerability scans, etc. for your code. You can also integrate them with your editor, IDE, or build tool to run your tests and generate your reports on save, on commit, or on build. When working with Federated Modules, you should use the same code quality and security tools and techniques across all your modules and applications. This will ensure that your code is tested and verified across different federated environments. You should also test and analyze the specific aspects of Federated Modules in your code, such as the dynamic loading, the module federation plugins, the shared scope, etc. For example, if you are using Jest for unit testing, you can add the following options to your jest.config.js file to support dynamic imports: module.exports = { // Use babel-jest to transform dynamic imports transform: { \"^.+\\\\.js$\": \"babel-jest\", }, // Use @module-federation/jest-federated-module-loader to mock remote modules moduleNameMapper: { \"@module-federation/jest-federated-module-loader\": \"@module-federation/jest-federated-module-loader\", }, }; If you are using Codecov for code coverage reporting, you can add the following options to your .codecov.yml file to ignore the module federation plugins: ignore: - \"**/webpack.config.js\" # Ignore webpack configuration files - \"**/remoteEntry.js\" # Ignore remote entry files generated by module federation plugins Dependency management and versioning are important for managing the external modules that your code depends on. They help you specify the exact versions of the modules that your code requires, avoid conflicts and compatibility issues with other modules or applications, and update your modules when new versions are available. They also make it easier to review your code changes and ensure that they do not introduce breaking changes or regressions. There are many tools available for dependency management and versioning, such as npm, yarn, pnpm, lerna, semver, etc. You can use them to install, update, and publish your modules to a package registry, such as npm or GitHub Packages. You can also use them to define the version ranges of your modules using semantic versioning, which indicates the level of changes in each version using major, minor, and patch numbers. When working with Federated Modules, you should use the same dependency management and versioning tools and practices across all your modules and applications. This will ensure that your modules are installed and updated consistently and correctly across different federated environments. You should also use semantic versioning for your modules and follow the principle of backward compatibility, which means that you should not introduce breaking changes in minor or patch versions. For example, if you are using npm for dependency management, you can add the following options to your package.json file to specify the version ranges of your dependencies using semantic versioning: { \"dependencies\": { \"lodash\": \"^4.17.21\", // Accept any patch version greater than or equal to 4.17.21 \"react\": \"~17.0.2\", // Accept any patch version greater than or equal to 17.0.2 but less than 17.1.0 \"webpack\": \"5.65.0\" // Accept only the exact version 5.65.0 } } If you are using lerna for versioning, you can add the following options to your lerna.json file to use semantic versioning for your packages: { \"version\": \"independent\", // Use independent versioning for each package \"command\": { \"version\": { \"conventionalCommits\": true // Use conventional commits to determine the version bump } } } Testing and debugging are essential for verifying the functionality and usability of your code. They help you find and fix errors, bugs, and issues that can affect the behavior and performance of your code. They also make it easier to review your code changes and ensure that they do not introduce new errors or regressions. There are many tools available for testing and debugging, such as Chrome DevTools, Firefox DevTools, Visual Studio Code, Webpack Dev Server, etc. You can use them to run your code in different browsers and devices, inspect and modify your code and data at runtime, set breakpoints and watch expressions, evaluate and execute your code in the console, etc. You can also integrate them with your editor, IDE, or build tool to launch and debug your code on save, on commit, or on build. When working with Federated Modules, you should use the same testing and debugging tools and techniques across all your modules and applications. This will ensure that your code is tested and debugged across different federated environments. You should also test and debug the specific aspects of Federated Modules in your code, such as the dynamic loading, the module federation plugins, the shared scope, etc. For example, if you are using Chrome DevTools for debugging, you can use the following steps to debug your federated modules: Open the Sources panel and enable JavaScript source maps in the Settings. Navigate to the webpack:// folder and find the federated modules that you want to debug. Set breakpoints or log points in the federated modules as you would normally do. Reload the page or trigger the dynamic import of the federated modules. Observe the execution of the federated modules in the debugger. (screenshot) If you are using Webpack Dev Server for testing, you can use the following options to enable hot module replacement (HMR) for your federated modules: module.exports = { // Enable HMR for development mode mode: \"development\", devServer: { hot: true, }, plugins: [ // Use ModuleFederationPlugin to expose or consume federated modules new ModuleFederationPlugin({ // Enable HMR for federated modules hot: true, // Other options... }), ], };","title":"Team collaboration and code review when working with Federated Modules","component":"mf-docs","version":"0.2","name":"team-collaboration-review","url":"/mf-docs/0.2/team-collaboration-review/","titles":[{"text":"Code formatting and linting","hash":"code-formatting-and-linting","id":1},{"text":"Code documentation and comments","hash":"code-documentation-and-comments","id":2},{"text":"Code quality and security","hash":"code-quality-and-security","id":3},{"text":"Dependency management and versioning","hash":"dependency-management-and-versioning","id":4},{"text":"Testing and debugging","hash":"testing-and-debugging","id":5}]},"24":{"id":24,"text":"In this guide, we’ll cover the best practices for creating unit tests for distributed code when using Module Federation. We’ll discuss the challenges and advantages of testing federated modules, along with techniques to ensure your tests are thorough and maintainable. Unit testing is crucial for ensuring the reliability and maintainability of your code, especially when working with distributed systems like Module Federation. It helps you catch errors early, verify the correctness of your code, and ensure that changes don’t introduce unexpected behavior. Testing federated modules can be more challenging than testing traditional code due to factors such as: At-runtime orchestration and code sharing Asynchronous module loading Remote dependencies and entry points Diverse application environments Despite these challenges, it’s essential to create robust unit tests for your distributed code to ensure its reliability and maintainability. Follow these best practices to ensure your unit tests for federated modules are effective and maintainable: Write independent test cases for each component or module to ensure that they can be tested in isolation. This approach helps you identify issues more easily and prevents cascading failures. Test your federated modules in different scenarios to ensure that they work correctly across various application environments and configurations. Ensure that your test suite provides comprehensive coverage of your distributed code, including edge cases and potential error conditions. The concept of federated unit testing builds upon the idea of federating features in Module Federation. In this approach, you create a test build for each repository involved in the federation, essentially creating a commonjs \"server\" build that exposes the features as commonjs modules. This allows you to test the federated components in isolation and perform liability testing. Let’s take a look at an example that demonstrates federated unit testing with Jest: Consider an application with a form that imports a federated button. import React, { Suspense } from \"react\"; import lazy from \"react-lazy-ssr\"; const Button = lazy( () => import(\"federated/Button\"), { chunkId: \"federated/Button\" } ); const Form = () => ( ); export default Form; In this scenario, there are two aspects to test: Button: supplied by its own Webpack build Form: supplied by its own Webpack build To enable federated unit testing, create test builds for each repository involved in the federation. In this example, we create test builds for both the form_app and the dsl repositories: form_app repository dsl repository new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: \"form_app\", filename: \"remoteEntry.js\", library: { type: \"commonjs-module\", name: \"form_app\" }, remotes: { \"dsl\": reunited( path.resolve(__dirname, \"../dsl/dist-test/remoteEntry.js\"), \"dsl\" ), }, exposes: { \"./Form\": \"./federated-cross-test/form.js\", }, shared: { react: deps.devDependencies.react, \"react-dom\": deps.devDependencies[\"react-dom\"], }, }); new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: \"dsl\", filename: \"remoteEntry.js\", library: { type: \"commonjs-module\", name: \"dsl\" }, exposes: { \"./Button\": \"./src/Button.js\", }, shared: { react: deps.devDependencies.react, \"react-dom\": deps.devDependencies[\"react-dom\"], }, }); Both Button and Form are exposed for liability testing. With the test builds in place, you can use Jest to run tests against a Webpack-built test of test files. This allows you to utilize Webpack’s async capabilities to import federated modules and test them. // federated.test.js import React from \"react\"; import { shallow, mount, render } from \"enzyme\"; // Form and Button are federated imports const Form = import(\"form_app/Form\"); const Button = import(\"dsl/Button\"); import suspenseRender from \"./suspenseRender\"; describe(\"Federation\", function () { it(\"is rendering Nested Suspense\", async () => { const from = await Form; console.log(await suspenseRender(from.default)); }); it(\"Testing Button from Remote\", async function () { const Btn = (await Button).default; const wrapper = render(); expect(wrapper).toMatchSnapshot(); }); it(\"Testing Button from Form\", async function () { const Frm = (await Form).default; const wrapper = mount(); expect(wrapper).toMatchSnapshot(); }); }); In this example, Jest processes an already-built test file, allowing you to use federated imports in your tests. This is made possible by using Webpack to compile the test files instead of Babel. To enable federated testing with Jest, you need a special Webpack build that compiles .test.js files only. // jest test/bundle.test.js // The webpack build that creates the test bundle. const path = require(\"path\"); const glob = require(\"glob\"); const thisFile = path.basename(__filename); const nodeExternals = require(\"webpack-node-externals\"); const { ModuleFederationPlugin } = require(\"webpack\").container; const ReactLazySsrPlugin = require(\"react-lazy-ssr/webpack\"); const reunited = require(\"../index\"); const testFiles = glob .sync(\"!(node_modules)/**/*.test.js\") .filter(function (element) { return ( element != \"test/bundle.test.js\" && !element.includes(thisFile) ); }) .map(function (element) { return \"./\" + element; }); module.exports = { entry: { \"bundle.test\": testFiles }, output: { path: path.resolve(__dirname, \".\"), filename: \"[name].js\", }, target: \"node\", resolve: { fallback: { path: false, }, }, externals: [ nodeExternals({ allowlist: [/^webpack\\/container\\/reference\\//, /react/], }), ], mode: \"none\", module: { rules: [ { test: /\\.js$/, exclude: /node_modules/, loader: \"babel-loader\", }, ], }, plugins: [ new ModuleFederationPlugin({ name: \"test_bundle\", library: { type: \"commonjs-module\", name: \"test_bundle\" }, filename: \"remoteEntry.js\", exposes: { \"./render\": \"./test/suspenseRender.js\", }, remotes: { form_app: reunited( path.resolve(__dirname, \"../form_app/dist/test/remoteEntry.js\"), \"form_app\" ), dsl: reunited( path.resolve(__dirname, \"../dsl/dist/remoteEntry.js\"), \"dsl\" ), }, }), new ReactLazySsrPlugin(), ], }; This build configuration includes the ModuleFederationPlugin and imports both the form_app and dsl repositories' test builds. Integrating federated unit testing into your CI pipeline can be accomplished in a few ways: Pull down other repositories or storage buckets and execute them locally within the test container. This is a rudimentary but effective approach. Use code streaming (not publicly available yet and planned to be commercial). This approach makes Node work like a browser by requiring modules over sockets, HTTP, or S3. It simplifies CI integration and offers a \"just works\" architecture. The goal of code streaming is to provide a more straightforward deployment mechanism, considering the vast resources spent on CI. For a complete example of federated unit testing, refer to the following repository: reunited: An example of federated unit testing This example demonstrates the core concept of having Jest process an already-built test file, enabling the use of federated imports in your tests. By following the steps and examples outlined in this guide, you can create a robust and maintainable testing strategy for your federated applications. By setting up the correct build configurations and leveraging the power of Module Federation, you can ensure that your distributed code remains functional and reliable. In summary, the essential steps to create unit tests for distributed code using Module Federation are: Expose components from each repository for testing. Create a test build for each repository that exposes components as CommonJS modules. Write federated test cases using Jest and the exposed components. Set up a special Webpack build configuration to compile .test.js files. Integrate federated unit testing into your CI pipeline using local execution or code streaming. With this approach, you can achieve a high degree of confidence that your federated modules will work correctly across different codebases and repositories. Moreover, by having individual teams take part in liability tests, you can ensure that updates and changes to federated modules do not cause unexpected issues in the consuming applications. The future of federated unit testing includes further simplifications and optimizations, such as code streaming, which will make the process even more seamless and accessible. By adopting these best practices and staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in Module Federation, you can continue to build and maintain high-quality distributed applications with ease.","title":"Module Federation: How to Create Unit Tests for Distributed Code","component":"mf-docs","version":"0.2","name":"unit-testing","url":"/mf-docs/0.2/unit-testing/","titles":[{"text":"Introduction to Unit Testing in Module Federation","hash":"introduction-to-unit-testing-in-module-federation","id":1},{"text":"Challenges in Testing Federated Modules","hash":"challenges-in-testing-federated-modules","id":2},{"text":"Best Practices for Testing Distributed Code","hash":"best-practices-for-testing-distributed-code","id":3},{"text":"Isolate Test Cases","hash":"isolate-test-cases","id":4},{"text":"Test Various Scenarios","hash":"test-various-scenarios","id":5},{"text":"Ensure Test Coverage","hash":"ensure-test-coverage","id":6},{"text":"Federated Unit Tests","hash":"federated-unit-tests","id":7},{"text":"1.

In this guide, we’ll explore some of the most common use cases for Module Federation, including examples of how it can be used in different scenarios. One of the most common use cases for Module Federation is in microfrontend architecture. This approach involves breaking down large monolithic applications into smaller, more manageable frontend modules that can be developed and deployed independently. With Module Federation, these modules can be shared between different applications, allowing for greater flexibility and modularity in application design. For example, imagine a large e-commerce platform with multiple frontend applications for product search, shopping cart, and checkout. By using Module Federation, the platform could share common modules such as user authentication and payment processing between the different frontend applications, reducing duplication and improving collaboration between development teams. Another common use case for Module Federation is in integrating multiple applications that share common functionality. With Module Federation, developers can share modules between different applications, allowing them to work together seamlessly and share data more efficiently. For example, imagine a suite of productivity applications such as a project management tool, a team communication app, and a time-tracking tool. By using Module Federation, these applications could share common modules such as user authentication and data storage, allowing them to work together seamlessly and share data more efficiently. Module Federation can also be used for integrating third-party modules and applications into an existing application. With Module Federation, developers can easily integrate modules from different sources, allowing them to incorporate external functionality into their applications without having to develop it from scratch. For example, imagine an e-commerce platform that wants to incorporate a third-party shipping module into their application. With Module Federation, the platform could easily integrate the shipping module into their application, allowing customers to see shipping options and prices in real-time. Finally, Module Federation can also be used for sharing libraries and other common code between different applications. With Module Federation, developers can easily share code libraries and other common functionality, reducing duplication and improving collaboration between development teams. For example, imagine a suite of applications that all require access to a common library of UI components. With Module Federation, these applications could share the UI component library, allowing developers to make changes and improvements to the library in one place, rather than having to make the same changes across multiple applications. By carefully considering the specific needs and requirements of their applications, developers can determine whether Module Federation is the right solution for their particular use case. Whether it’s microfrontend architecture, multi-application integration, third-party integrations, or shared libraries, Module Federation can help developers to reduce duplication, improve collaboration, and increase flexibility in application design.","title":"Use Cases for Module Federation","component":"mf-docs","version":"0.2","name":"use-cases","url":"/mf-docs/0.2/use-cases/","titles":[{"text":"Use Case 1: Microfrontend Architecture","hash":"use-case-1-microfrontend-architecture","id":1},{"text":"Use Case 2: Multi-Application Integration","hash":"use-case-2-multi-application-integration","id":2},{"text":"Use Case 3: Third-Party Integrations","hash":"use-case-3-third-party-integrations","id":3},{"text":"Use Case 4: Shared Libraries","hash":"use-case-4-shared-libraries","id":4},{"text":"Conclusion","hash":"conclusion","id":5}]},"26":{"id":26,"text":"This article covers the enhanced features of Module Federation, focusing on the concept of versioned shared modules. This concept introduces a new system based on the versions of shared modules, thus improving the federated builds' management, especially in complex host-remote relationship scenarios. The new system changes the traditional host-remote relationship by basing shared modules on their versions. In a federated build group, all parts agree on the highest version of a shared module. Each version of the shared module undergoes a semver-based requirement check. It allows the existence of multiple versions of a shared module, consumed as per the required version. This strategy enables remotes to provide an upgraded version of a shared module to the federated app, paving the way for better decoupling between the host and the remotes. You might choose to consume a shared module but not provide one. This strategy can reduce build time and deployment size when the container is always used within a shell that provides these shared modules. Version checking for shared modules can be either strict or loose. Strict mode: The shared module won’t be used if the version is not in the valid range. Instead, a fallback is used. Loose mode: Shared modules are always used, but a warning is printed for invalid versions. The fallback is only used when no shared module is available. There is an initialization phase in which all remotes (including remotes of remotes) get an opportunity to provide shared modules. This is vital as a deep nested remote might require a higher version of a shared module and needs to have a chance to provide it. You can specify versions for your shared modules in three ways: This syntax allows you to share libraries with package name only. This approach is good for prototyping, but it will not allow you to scale to large production environment given that libraries like react and react-dom will require additional requirements. const { ModuleFederationPlugin } = require('webpack').container; module.exports = { plugins: [ new ModuleFederationPlugin({ // adds lodash as shared module // version is inferred from package.json // there is no version check for the required version // so it will always use the higher version found shared: ['lodash'], }), ], }; While specifying shared packages, it is also essential to manage their versions correctly. By default, the system infers the versions from your package.json file. However, you can explicitly specify the version or a range of versions using [Semantic Versioning SemVer Here are some examples that further illustrate how to specify package versions for shared modules: // Example 6: Do not provide a local version, emit a warning if the shared vue is = 3 shared: { \"vue\": { import: false, requiredVersion: \"^2.6.5\", strictVersion: true } } // Example 7: Add all dependencies as shared modules, using versions from package.json shared: require(\"./package.json\").dependencies // Example 8: Change specific entries using object spread const deps = require(\"./package.json\").dependencies; shared: { ...deps, react: { requiredVersion: deps.react, singleton: true } } // Example 9: Configure shared module with specific requirements shared: { \"my-vue\": { import: \"vue\", shareKey: \"shared-vue\", shareScope: \"default\", singleton: true, strictVersion: true, version: \"1.2.3\", requiredVersion: \"^1.0.0\" } } In the requiredVersion field, simple semantic versioning is allowed. You can use the ^, ~, >=, and exact matching symbols. More complex ranges are not supported to avoid the need for significant runtime code. This syntax allows you to provide additional hints to each shared package where you define the package name as the key, and the value as an object containing hints to modify sharing behavior. const deps = require('./package.json').dependencies; module.exports = { plugins: [ new ModuleFederationPlugin({ shared: { // adds react as shared module react: { requiredVersion: deps.react, singleton: true, }, }, }), ], }; boolean` This hint will allow webpack to include the provided and fallback module directly instead of fetching the library via an asynchronous request. In other words, this allows to use this shared module in the initial chunk. Also, be careful that all provided and fallback modules will always be downloaded when this hint is enabled. false | string The provided module that should be placed in the shared scope. This provided module also acts as fallback module if no shared module is found in the shared scope or version isn’t valid. (The value for this hint defaults to the property name.) string The package name that is used to determine required version from description file. This is only needed when the package name can’t be automatically determined from request. false | string The required version of the package. It accepts semantic versioning. For example, \"^1.2.3\". string The requested shared module is looked up under this key from the shared scope. string The name of the shared scope. boolean This hint only allows a single version of the shared module in the shared scope (disabled by default). Some libraries use a global internal state (e.g. react, react-dom). Thus, it is critical to have only one instance of the library running at a time. In cases where there are multiple versions of the same dependency in the shared scope, the highest semantic version is used. boolean The strictVersion property plays a crucial role in managing shared modules. If strictVersion is set to true, the shared module won’t be used unless the version is valid. In such cases, singleton or modules without fallback will throw an error, otherwise the fallback module is used. When a fallback module is provided, it is recommended to set strictVersion to true as it will ensure that the shared module is only used if its version is valid. If the shared module’s version is not valid, then the fallback module will be used instead, providing a safe fallback mechanism. false | string The version of the provided module. It allows webpack to replace lower matching versions, but not higher. By default, Webpack uses the version from the package.json file of the dependency. Here are a few examples that illustrate the various possibilities: // Example 1: Always use the higher version found shared: [\"react\"] // Example 2: Use the highest moment version that is >= 2.20 and = 17 shared: { \"react\": { requiredVersion: \"^16.7.0\", singleton: true } } // Example 4: Emit a warning if the shared vue is = 3 shared: { \"vue\": { import: false, requiredVersion: \"^2.6.5\" } } // Example 5: Throw an error when the shared vue is = 3 shared: { \"vue\": { import: false, requiredVersion: \"^2.6.5\", strictVersion: true } } In these examples, the shared property defines the shared modules, either as an array of module names or as an object with additional configuration options. It’s important to note that while hosts previously had clear control from host to remote, the new system based on shared module versions allows remotes to provide a higher version of a shared module to the federated app. This change also permits two remotes to share a module without the host being involved, or to share two different (major) versions of a module, while still reusing compatible versions. Remember that an initialization phase allows all remotes (including remotes of remotes) to provide shared modules. This phase is crucial, as some deeply nested remote might need a higher version of a shared module and should have the opportunity to provide it. Asynchronous loading is available for all remotes during this initialization phase. By implementing and understanding these concepts, you can effectively manage the versions of shared modules in a Module Federation context, ensuring smoother collaboration and more reliable app performance. A core advantage of the Module Federation approach lies in the ability to dynamically consume modules from different containers. It allows modules to be retrieved and initialized at runtime, fostering a flexible and efficient application architecture. This strategy also allows you to load an A/B test dynamically, providing some newer versions of a shared module. Here is a sample code snippet on how to use a container dynamically: // Initializes the share scope. This fills it with known provided modules from this build and all remotes await __webpack_initialize_sharing__(\"default\"); const container = window.someContainer; // or get the container somewhere else // Initialize the container, it may provide shared modules await container.init(__webpack_share_scopes__.default); const module = await container.get(\"./module\"); In the above code: First, we initialize the share scope using webpack_initialize_sharing. This action fills the share scope with known provided modules from this build and all remotes. Next, we assign a specific container (in this case, someContainer) to the container variable. You might retrieve the container from the window object or any other source depending on your application architecture. Then, we call container.init and pass webpack_share_scopes.default as the argument. This action initializes the container, and it may provide shared modules. Finally, we call container.get with the module path we want to load from the container. The get method returns a promise, so we use the await keyword to pause execution until the promise is resolved. If the container attempts to provide a shared module that has already been used, a warning will be issued, and the provided shared module will be ignored. However, the container might still use it as a fallback. Shared modules can operate in a singleton mode where only a single version of the shared module is allowed. Any remote in the application can provide this version, even if it’s a deeply nested remote requiring a higher version of the shared module. This version would then be used for the entire application. Also, you may want your shared modules to be provided synchronously by making them \"eager\". Eager shared modules are not placed in an asynchronous chunk, enabling their use in the initial chunk. However, be careful with this feature as all provided and fallback modules will always be downloaded, which can lead to performance issues. It’s recommended to use this feature judiciously, providing eager modules only at a single point of your app, such as the shell. // Example 10: Providing an eager module shared: { ...deps, react: { eager: true, singleton: true, requiredVersion: deps.react, }, \"react-dom\": { eager: true, singleton: true, requiredVersion: deps[\"react-dom\"], }, },","title":"Module Federation: Versioned Shared
